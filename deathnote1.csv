Gook,What. A pair of sleeping skulls?
Deridovely,"Hehe, I win again! No hard feelings, right?"
Gook,"Hey there, Ryuk, would it kill you to join us? You should come play with us for a change!"
Ryuk,"No, I'll pass."
,Light's classroom
English teacher,Listen for the voice of God then follow it and know that in time you will find your salvation.
Talking Girl 1,"I know, I didn't even do anything wrong! He just totally snapped at me!"
Talking Girl 2,Really?
Teacher,"Yagami, are you still with us? Can you please translate the following sentence into English?"
Light,[Sigh] Follow the teachings of God and receive his blessings and so it shall be that the seas will again become bountiful and the raging storms will subside.
,"News are being broadcasted, then Light is shown walking home."
Newscaster,"Today, at approximately 11 am a 32-year-old man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in the city of Yokohama Karigara Prefecture. Karigawa police are treating this case as a homicide."
Newscaster 2,"In other news, today, suspected murderer Naoki Tokuji was arrested in the district of Shibuya Tokyo. He is being held in custody facing murder charges for the brutal slaying of his common-law partner, who was only 25 at the time of death."
Light,"Day in and day out, the same news on permanent repeat."
Ryuk,This is all so ridiculous.
Light,This world is…
Ryuk,Rotten.
,Next day at school
Teacher,Another noticeable consequence is the extinction of many species on the planet. Species are now becoming extinct at a faster rate than has ever occurred in our recorded history.
Chatting boy,No way! You paged [unintelligible]
,"Death Note falls from the sky, indistinct chattering of students. Light notices and walks outside to pick it up."
Light,"Death Note? As in a notebook of death? Hmm. How to use it: the human whose name is written in this notebook… shall die! Hmm. It's pretty lame, not to mention twisted. It's really not that different from one of those chain letters you get. A human whose name is written in this notebook shall die? Come on."
,Train whistle
Light,"There must be something wrong with me to even consider it. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds. Hmm, so depending on the person you have in mind you can either kill them easily or painfully, huh. This is pretty detailed for a prank, I'll give them that. Hmm… so I write a name and that person… dies. Like anyone would believe that. Ugh! Wait, on the off chance someone really dies, would that make me a murderer? Yeah right, it's completely impossible."
Newscaster 3,"The same assailant who attacked 6 people at a busy shopping district in Sinjuku yesterday has struck again, taking 8 people hostage at this daycare center. His captives include both children and teachers. The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Kuro Otoharada, currently unemployed. We expect negotiations to begin immediately."
,Light writes the name of the suspect.
Light,"Hmm, a heart attack in 40 seconds? We'll see."
Newscaster 3,"At the present time, that's all the police are telling us."
Newscaster 4,You can't help but feel concerned for the safety of those hostages.
Newscaster 3,You're absolutely right. We'll continue to monitor the situation from here.
Newscaster 4,"Thank you for that report. What do you make of this, Mr. Hashimoto?"
Mr. Hashimoto,"Well, one can only hope for a quick resolution to this situation."
Light,"Looks like the notebook doesn't work. Oh well, I didn't expect it to anyway."
Newscaster 4,"Wait, we're seeing something here! Looks like there's movement at the front entrance!"
Newscaster 3,"The hostages are coming out, and they all look to be unharmed! The Special Forces are taking action; they're moving in! We don't know if the suspect's been arrested. Huh? Yes? Ok, we now have confirmation. The suspect has been found dead inside! I repeat, the suspect is now dead!"
Light,Dead?
Newscaster 3,The Special Forces are denying allegations that they shot the suspect.
Newscaster 4,"So, it's quite possible he was feeling cornered and decided to commit suicide?"
Newscaster 3,"Well, according to statements from hostages the suspect just suddenly collapsed."
Light,A heart attack? No way! It's coincidence! This has to be a coincidence!
Sachiko,"Light! It's already 6:30, you know! Don't you have cram school tonight?"
Light,"Yeah, I'll be ready in just a sec. The Death Note, it's unlikely, but if by chance this thing is for real, I have to test it one more time. In which case, it should probably be another criminal. But if he's too well-known, that will be a problem. If he dies, there's a good possibility that news of his death will be covered up. I need to see results right away."
,Classroom
Sudou,"Hey, Ryo buddy."
Ryo,"What is it, Sudou?"
Sudou,Didn't you want to lend me 20 dollars?
Ryo,"What, again? But I can't do that."
Light,Sudou…
Sudou,You can't…
Light,"Maybe I should try killing him. No, I should definitely avoid killing people I know. Then again, does it even really matter? I mean, would anyone really care if I guy like him was to disappear one day?"
Sudou,"Sweet, looks like we'll be hanging at the arcade after school."
,Street
Random Street Girl 1,"We're having a speed dating party tomorrow, you wanna come?"
Random Street Girl 2,"Yeah, of course."
Random Street Girl 3,"Oh yeah, there's no way I'm missing that."
Ryo,"Dammit, why is my mom so useless! She's never here to pick me up on time!"
Light,"Once you actually start looking around, it makes you wonder if you'd be doing society a favor by getting rid of all these people."
Takuo,"Hey baby, where you going? Come have a little fun with us!"
Henchman 1,That's our Takuo for ya. This guy can spot a hottie a mile away.
Takuo,"What's up, little lady? The name's Takuo Shibuimaru. What do ya say? Come hang out with us, pretty lady."
Lady,"Please, I don't want any trouble."
Henchman 1,You hear that? She doesn't want trouble.
Henchman 2,Isn't that cute.
Takuo,"Let's go, boys. Strip her down right here."
Henchman 1,Are you sure?
Lady,No! Stop! Please! Help me!
,Light writes Takuo's name.
Light,"Now, what will happen?"
Takuo,"Hey, wait up!"
Henchman 2,"Takuo, look out!"
,Lady screams after Takuo is killed by a truck.
Light,"[Gasp] That settles it. The Death Note, it's for real!"
Henchman 1,Oh man! Takuo!
Henchman 2,"Stupid kid, he just came outta nowhere! Arrgh!"
,Back at the Shinigami Realm
Ryuk,"Now then, I'd better get going."
,Commercial break
Ryuk,"It's been five days. Now then, I'd better get going."
Deridovely,"Eh? You headed somewhere, Ryuk?"
Gook,"Hate to tell you, but our whole world looks like this."
Ryuk,"That's true, but I've dropped my Death Note."
,Laughter
Deridovely,"You really messed things up, didn't you?"
Gook,Hold on a sec. Didn't you already trick the Old Man to get a second book? Don't tell me you dropped both of them.
Deridovely,You must have some idea where you dropped the thing?
Ryuk,"Yeah, the human world."
Deridovely & Gook,What?!
,"Exits Shinigami Realm and enters Human World. Thunder cracks, wings flap."
Sachiko,What a nice surprise! I wasn't expecting you home so early.
Light,"Yeah. Hi mom. It's because… Huh? Oh, the results of the nationwide exams."
Sachiko,I've been waiting all day.
Light,Here.
Sachiko,Goodness! Number one again! These are the highest scores you've had.
Light,"Yeah, I guess. I'm going to study in my room so please don't interrupt me, ok?"
Sachiko,"As you wish. Oh Light, do you want anything at all, dear? You can ask for whatever you like."
Light,"No, I'm fine, Mom. Thanks though. I've already got what I want."
,Opens Death Note and observes all the names he's written. Laughs maniacally.
Ryuk,You've taken quite a liking to it.
,Light screams and falls over.
Ryuk,"No reason to act surprised. I am the Shinigami, Ryuk. That used to be my notebook. Judging by your laughter, you've already figured out that what you have is no ordinary notebook."
Light,"Shinigami, a God of Death, huh? Well, I'm not surprised. In fact… Ryuk, I've been waiting for you."
Ryuk,Oh?
Light,"I've already figured out that this Death Note that I've found is real. It didn't take me long. And now that I've witnessed the proof of its power, I only feel more confident in what I'm gonna do."
Ryuk,"That's interesting. I certainly wasn't expecting this. Several Death Notes have made their way into the human world in the past, but you're the first to have written this many names. Look at how many people you’ve killed in only five days. Most are reluctant to write this much."
Light,"I've already prepared myself, Ryuk. I used the notebook even though I knew it belonged to a Shinigami, and now that Shinigami has come. So what will happen to me? You're here to take my soul, right?"
Ryuk,"Hmm, what do you mean? Is that some fantasy you humans came up with? I'm not gonna do anything to you. The notebook becomes part of the human realm from the very moment it touches the earth. In other words, the notebook is now yours."
Light,This… is mine?
Ryuk,"If you don't want it, just give it to someone else. But if you give it away, I'd have no choice but to erase your memories of the notebook."
Light,"So, then, you're saying I can use the Death Note all I want and I won't be punished?"
Ryuk,"Let's just say this, you will feel the fear and pain known only to humans who have used the notebook. And when it's your time to die, it will fall on me to write your name in my Death Note. Be warned, any human who's used a Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity. That's all. [Laughs.] Now you have something to look forward to after you die."
,Sachiko knocks on the door.
Light,Unh!
Sachiko,Light?
Ryuk,It'll be alright. Answer it.
Light,What is it?
Sachiko,I thought you'd like some apples the neighbors brought them over for us. Why on earth is it so dark in your room? You'll ruin your eyesight.
Light,What's going on? Mom can't see him?
Ryuk,"That notebook you found originally belonged to me, and since you're now using it, you are the only one able to see me, and of course, my voice can only be heard by you. In other words, the Death Note is the bond between Light, the human and Ryuk, the Shinigami. [Bites an apple] Yum."
Light,"I just have one more question I wanna ask you. Why was I chosen for this? [Ryuk devours two apples] Hey, are you even listening?"
Ryuk,Apples in the human world are worth the trip. What's the best way to describe these? Juicy?
Light,Just answer my question?
Ryuk,"[Scoffs] I didn't choose you. Don't you see? This is all just an accident. You actually thought you were chosen because you're so smart or something? Don't be so vain. It just happened to fall around here, and you just happened to pick it up. And that's all there is to it. That's why I wrote the instructions in English, the most popular language in the human world."
Light,"Then why did you drop it in the first place? You even wrote down specific instructions, so don't try telling me this was an accident!"
Ryuk,You're asking me why? I did it 'cause I was bored.
Light,You were bored?
Ryuk,"The truth is Shinigami haven't got much to do these days. Most of the time we're either taking naps or gambling. If you take the time to write names in your Death Note, the others just laugh at you for working so hard. Even if you wrote the name of another Shinigami, it'd be pointless because they wouldn't die. And since we live in the Shinigami Realm, it brings us no amusement to kill those in the human world either. So I figured I'd have more fun if I came down here myself. Anyway, I'm surprised at how many names you've written, but I wanna know why you only wrote the cause of death for that guy who was hit by the truck."
Light,"If you don't write down the cause of death, the victim dies of a heart attack, and that's probably the best thing about the Death Note, Ryuk. You see, I've already exhausted the list of the world's major criminals, and eventually, I'm going to get rid of them all."
Ryuk,What's the point of doing that?
Light,It's only a matter of time before people figure out that these criminals are being eliminated by someone. I want the world to know of my existence. That there's someone passing righteous judgement on the wicked!
Ryuk,"Why even bother? What are you trying to achieve by passing judgement on them. I mean, why do you care?"
Light,"Because… I've been bored too. I wasn't ready to believe it at first, but it's obvious now. There's something about the Death Note itself that makes humans want to try it out at least once."
,Flashback after Taruo's death
Light,"I killed them both. I really… I killed to men. Those were human lives, it won't be overlooked. Besides, who am I to pass judgement on others? Uhh… no, no wait. Maybe I'm wrong. This is exactly what I've been thinking about lately. This world is rotting, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world can't go on like this."
,Flashback in the classroom
Light,"I've wondered… what if someone else picked up this notebook. Is there anyone out there, other than me, who would be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it; there's no one, but I can do it. In fact, I'm the only one who can. I'll do it, using the Death Note, I'll change the world."
,Various criminals groan and die as Light writes their names.
Light,"At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of. Like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice, and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking."
Ryuk,"But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left."
Light,Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hard working honor student considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest. And I… I will become the God of this New World.
Ryuk,"It's just as I thought, humans are so interesting."
,Ending credits
,Next episode preview
Light,[Laughs] I'll show the world what happens when you try to cross me. The entire world is watching now… L.
,Opening chants
Light,The human whose name is written in this notebook shall die…
,Flashback to Light killing Takuo
Takuo,[Laughs] Woo!
Lady,Help me!
Light,Now… what will happen?
,Takuo is killed by a truck.
Light,"The Death Note, it's for real!"
,"Flashback changes to Light encountering Ryuk, where Light screams and falls after seeing him"
Ryuk,Any human who's used a Death Note can neither go to heaven nor hell for eternity.
Light,I want the world to know of my existence. That there's someone passing righteous judgement on the wicked! And I… I will become the God of this New World!
,Flashback commences then switches to present time
English teacher,"He found himself overwhelmed with happiness and satisfaction, [Girl talking: I have no idea what he was thinking coming to my house, but I am so through with him.] [Boy: Seriously? So what happened with your dad after that?] knowing that, at long last, his dream had finally come true. Alright then. Yagami? Please recite this line for us."
,Light stands up.
Light,"Sure. Having finally made his dream a reality, he was overwhelmed. Both by the magnitude of his achievement, and by the joy and happiness that it brought him."
,Light sits back down.
English teacher,"That was very well done, but I'm not surprised, of course. Absolutely flawless. Very good. Well then, we'll leave it at that for today."
,The students groan and get up from their seats. The bell rings.
Ryuk,"[Outside] I thought it'd never end. How do you do this every day? It's so boring here. Hey, where're you going? Hey, Light! Are you listening to me?"
Light,"[Quietly] Don't talk to me. Unlike you, people can still hear me when I talk out loud."
Ryuk,"Heh, well aren't you boring."
Young man,"Hey, what's up, Light? We were just going to head down to the—"
Light,"Sorry, I'm a little busy today."
Ryuk,"You don't have anything to do. Aren't you just going to go home and hang out in your room, as usual?"
Light,"What are you talking about? Of course I have something to do. Yes, something very important."
,Scene change. A news broadcast is playing on the TV in Light's bedroom. Light is writing names down in his Death Note.
News Reporter,"There was more violence across the city today. Another stabbing, this time at a restaurant in the heart of the Kabuki-cho district of Shinjuku."
,"Ryuk sits on Light's bed, munching on an apple."
Ryuk,"[Bites an apple] Mmm. Hey, Light. [Swallows] I'm talking to you."
Light,What is it?
Ryuk,Why are you working so hard?
Light,"I can't afford to waste any time. I have a very small window to write names in this notebook. I only have from when I get home from school until I go to bed. I still need to sleep so I can maintain my average and stay at the top of my class. Obviously, I can't be sleeping in class. Plus, there's all the studying at home and at cram school. I can't let myself get too tired. It will start to affect my health and my mental performance. If I'm serious about trying to create an ideal world that's free from evil then I need to make the most of my time."
,The door knob turns then clicks as it stops.
Sayu,"Huh? Weird. Hey, Light, what's going on? Why is your door locked?"
Light,It's Sayu. What is it?
Sayu,Can you help me with my homework?
Light,"Uh, yeah. Okay."
,Light puts the Death Note in his desk drawer and goes to open the door.
Sayu,"We're doing quadratic equations in math. Sorry to interrupt. I know you're studying right now, but I'm like the only person in my class who doesn't get this stuff. Thanks so much!"
Light,No problem.
Ryuk,"I'd be careful if I were you. If anyone else touches that notebook you've got hidden in the drawer right now, they'll be able to see me too."
Light,"[Thinking] Huh, he waits till now to mention that important detail?! Damn Shinigami."
Sayu,What's wrong? Are you alright?
Light,Hm? It's nothing. So what exactly don't you understand? What are you stuck on?
Sayu,Um…well…I think all of it.
,Scene change to ICPO headquarters.
Delegate 1,"There have been fifty-two deaths that we're aware of, and that's just in the past week."
Delegate 2,Every single one of them involved a heart attack.
Delegate 1,They were all criminals who were either being held in prison or who were wanted by police for outstanding crimes. And I think it's safe to say there are other criminals whose deaths are unaccounted for.
Delegate 3,In which case the death toll could be well over 100.
Matsuda,"Uh… morning, Chief. They started the meeting without you."
Soichiro,That's fine. I had to take an urgent call from headquarters.
Delegate 2,"At any rate, these were criminals who were probably facing execution sooner or later. Perhaps we shouldn't be—"
Delegate 1,"Why should it matter if it's a criminal or someone innocent?! Last time I checked, murder was still murder!"
Delegate 3,It's still too early to consider these a homicide.
Delegate 1,"Then how did all these people have heart attacks at the exact same time?! That's not coincidence, it's murder!"
Delegate 3,You think it's possible to simultaneously kill all these people in different locations?
Delegate 4,We're treating this as an elaborate murder plot that's been carried out by a large organization.
Delegate 5,"If it is a large organization, I'm sure I'm not alone in suspecting the FBI or CIA."
Delegate 6,[Off-screen] I dare you to say that again!
Delegate 7,"Now, now, this is not the time to be joking around! We need to confirm that these are indeed homicides and not coincidences!"
Delegate 3,"How? Autopsy results show that in all of these cases, the victims died of a sudden heart attack."
Delegate 4,Investigating a series of heart attacks is pointless. I don't see what else we can learn.
Delegate 5,"Absolutely. If these people had been shot or stabbed, at least we'd have something to go on."
Delegate 1,"If that's the case, it looks as if we'll have no choice but to bring in L."
,The room quiets down and people begin murmuring amongst themselves.
Matsuda,"Uh, Chief. What's this ""L"" they're talking about?"
Soichiro,"Right, I forgot that it's your first time at this conference. We don't know L's real name or whereabouts. In fact, we still don't even know what he looks like. However, he's managed to solve every case he's ever taken on. And he's tackled some of the greatest mysteries this world has even known. He hides in the shadows, but he's the best of the best. A last resort. Our trump card."
Delegate 8,"But I've heard this ""L"" is extremely arrogant and has tended to only take on cases that he's personally interested in."
Delegate 9,"That's exactly right! Besides, we don't even know how to contact him!"
Watari,L is already on the move.
,"The room goes quiet as Watari enters, hidden in a black trench coat and hat."
Watari,"Gentlemen, L has already begun his investigation into these incidents."
Matsuda,Huh? Who's that?
Soichiro,That man's the only known person who can contact L. Nobody knows his true identity either.
Watari,Please be silent. L would now like to address the delegates.
,Watari opens a laptop.
L (voice altered via voice distorter),Greetings to all of you at the ICPO. I…am L.
,Scene change. The camera pans across the outside of a run-down building.
Ryuk,[Inside] What are we doing here anyway? I don't understand why we're sneaking around this dump. Tell me.
Light,"Isn't it obvious? Anyone who touches the Death Note will be able to see you. I can't afford to carry something this dangerous with me anymore. Up until now, I thought that if my family ever saw the notebook, I can tell them I was keeping records of various criminals in preparation for becoming a detective one day. But I'm walking a very fine line right now. I don't want to think about it, but if I make one mistake, I might end up killing my own family."
,Light mixes two liquids which then ignite. Scene change back to ICPO headquarters.
L,"The difficulty of this case lies on its unprecedented scope. And make no mistake. We are witnessing an atrocious act of mass murder, one that is unforgivable. This case cannot be solved without the full cooperation of the ICPO. That is all of the police organizations you represent throughout the world. You need to make the decision to fully support the investigation at this meeting. Also, I require additional cooperation from Japan's National Police Agency."
Soichiro,Huh? What? Why Japan in particular?
L,"Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese. And even if they are not, we can be sure they're hiding in Japan."
Soichiro,What is all this based on?
L,"Why Japan, you ask? I think I will be able to provide you with proof of that after I directly confront the culprit."
Soichiro,A direct confrontation?
L,"At any rate, I would like to set up the investigation headquarters in Japan."
,Scene change. Light's room. Light relaxes into his desk chair.
Light,That was easier to make than I thought it'd be.
Ryuk,Huh? Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?
Light,Yeah. I hid it right here in this drawer.
Ryuk,But it doesn't seem to be particularly well hidden. You left the key in the lock.
Light,And that's the whole point. I intentionally left the key in the most noticeable place I could think of.
,"Light opens the drawer, revealing a brown leather diary."
Ryuk,Isn't that just a regular diary?
Light,"That's what it is. I'm guessing that once most people find the diary inside my desk, that'll probably satisfy their curiosity. But the real key is this. Just an everyday item you'd expect to find lying around on my desk. A regular ball-point pen, and all I need is this part."
,He removes the ink reservoir of the pen.
Ryuk,So that's the key?
Light,"Yeah. If you look closely, you'll find there's a small hole underneath the drawer. Then you just insert this."
,"Light inserts the ink filler into the hole. It lifts up the bottom of the drawer, revealing the Death Note in the real drawer."
Ryuk,Aha. A fake bottom. The diary will distract most people so I doubt anyone will find it.
Light,But that's not all.
Ryuk,Oh?
Light,"Even if someone figures out there's a fake base, I've set things up so that there's no way they could get their hands on the notebook. You see, once the ink reservoir is inserted, it accesses an insulator, preventing the flow of electricity around this circuit. When the fake base of the drawer's put back, this piece of rubber also prevents the flow of electricity. However, if someone were to try and force the bottom of the drawer open, the circuit would connect and now would ignite the gasoline contained in this thin plastic casing, instantly setting the notebook on fire. The way I’ve got it set up, all the evidence will be completely destroyed. If I'm ever questioned, I'd say that I was hiding the real diary because I didn't want anyone to see it. It sounds like a pretty believable excuse. I mean, it is my diary after all."
Ryuk,"I've heard of humans finding Death Notes in the past and typically the biggest problem they had was finding a good place to hide it. But you, Light, you're probably the first to have given it this much thought. Though, it's a pretty risky setup from the look of it. If you make even the slightest mistake, you could be badly burned."
Light,"Risky? You say the strangest thing sometimes, Ryuk. This whole thing has been a risk since the very beginning, from the moment I obtained the Death Note. I'm sorry, but compared to that, this doesn't even qualify as a risk to me. In fact, it actually protects me. It all comes down to a choice: would I prefer to be executed or deal with a little house fire?"
,Commercial break
,Scene change to Daikoku Private Academy.
Announcer,"Last night in the West Tokyo penitentiary, Naoki Koro Kitayama, originally sentenced to fifteen years for armed robbery, was reported to have died of a sudden heart attack at the age of thirty-two. This is just the most recent death in the steadily growing number of cases involving inmates dying of heart attacks."
Student 1,This is unbelievable. Criminals are dropping like flies lately.
Student 2,"It's a little scary, but at the same time, it's kind of cool."
Student 1,Sure. Just make sure you don't do anything bad.
Student 3,I won't be surprised if the police were behind this.
Student 2,No way. The police don't have that kind of power.
Student 1,Don't you know about him?
Student 3,Huh? About who?
Student 1,"Kira. You know, Kira."
Student 4,I wonder who's gonna be killed next.
,Scene change to Light's room. Light looks at his computer.
Light,"Ryuk, you should check this out."
Ryuk,Huh?
,Ryuk moves to stand behind Light.
Light,Websites like this are popping up everywhere lately.
Ryuk,The Legend of Kira the Savior. Huh. Sounds pretty cool. Is this about you?
Light,"Yeah. I think they've taken the name ""Kira"" from the English word ""killer."" Can't say I'm too happy about that, but it looks like that's the name they've decided to give me. When I search the word Kira, I'm pulling up tons of sites just like this one. The media hasn't picked up on it. They're still calling this a succession of unexplained deaths among the world's most hardened criminals. But…the people of the world can already sense that there's something happening. They know there's someone out there passing righteous judgment."
Ryuk,Oh?
Light,"Human beings are like that, Ryuk."
Ryuk,Huh.
Light,"Although this would probably never happen in school, let's say that students were asked to discuss whether bad people deserve to die. Well, you can bet that everyone will give the politically correct answer."
,Scene change to Daikoku Private Academy.
Girl,It's just wrong to kill people.
,Scene change. Back to Light's room.
Light,"That's what they are bound to say. Of course, that's the correct response to give, right? Humans are always trying to maintain appearances when they're in public. That's just how we are. But this is how they really feel. Most are too afraid to support me as they're worried about what others would think. Many would rather deny my existence. But on the Internet, where you can remain anonymous, support for Kira is growing. Maybe people are afraid to say it out loud, but they all understand what's happening. Someone's making the bad guys disappear one by one. Those who have done no wrong are cheering for Kira in their hearts because they have nothing to fear, while those who have done wrong are on the run. They are forced to hide from an unknown enemy. This is how it should be. It's perfect. Everything is going just like I planned."
,Time change. Later that afternoon in Light's room.
TV Announcer,"We'd like to apologize for the interruption. As of now, we're bringing you a live worldwide broadcast from Interpol, ICPO."
Ryuk,Hm? What's this?
Light,Interpol?
TV Announcer,We now take you live to the ICPO.
Lind L. Tailor,"I head up an International Police Task Force which includes all member nations. I am Lind L. Tailor, otherwise known as L."
Light,Huh? Who is this guy?
,Scene change to the Japan National Police Agency headquarters.
Soichiro,So this is how it all begins.
Matsuda,"But, sir, I don't get it. He's never actually shown his face before, right? Why would he choose to do it now?"
Soichiro,It must mean L's serious about this.
Matsuda,Hm.
Soichiro,"[Thinking] L, we've followed every single one of your orders. Now, it's time for you to prove what you said to the ICPO."
,Scene change to Light's room.
Lind L. Tailor (on television screen),"Criminals around the world are being murdered by a serial killer. I consider this crime to be the most atrocious act of murder in history. I will not rest until the person or persons responsible are brought to justice. Kira, I will hunt you down. I will find you."
Ryuk,He seems certain he'll catch you.
Light,"Hm. That fool. He'll never find me. [Picks up the Death Note and stands] He'll have to get this first. And as long as the police don't find it, there won't be any evidence to convict me, which means catching me will be absolutely impossible. [Relaxes in his chair] I anticipated that the police would get involved and that something like this might happen."
Lind L. Tailor,"Kira, I've got a pretty good idea what your motivation might be, and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil."
,Light gasps and stands up.
Light,"You think…I'm evil? I am justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil! I'm the one who will become the god of a new world that everyone desires! All those who oppose that god, they are the ones who are truly evil!"
,Light opens the Death Note and readies a pen. He looks back up at the television.
Light,"I guess you're just too stupid, L. Too bad. This could've been a lot more interesting if you'd only been a bit smarter."
,Light writes Lind L. Tailor's name in large letters and laughs maniacally. He looks back at the screen.
Light,I'll show the world what happens when you cross me. The entire world is watching…L.
,Light glances at his watch.
Light,Five more seconds.
,The second hand on the watch ticks audibly as Light counts down. The camera changes between the two scenes.
Light,Four…three…two…one…
,"Lind L. Tailor collapses, dead. Light gasps then laughs maniacally."
Light,What's wrong? You've got nothing else to say?
,"Two suited men with black sunglasses remove Lind L. Tailor's body from view as Light continues to laugh. L's symbol suddenly flashes on screen, silencing Light."
L (through voice modifier),"Ah. I had to test this, just in case, but I-I never thought it would actually happen. Kira…it seems you can kill people without having to be there in person. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't just witnessed it. Listen to me, Kira. If you did, indeed, kill Lind L. Tailor, the man who you just saw die on television, I should tell you that he was an inmate whose execution was scheduled for today. That was not me."
Light,What?
L,"The police arrested him in absolute secrecy, so you wouldn't have heard of him on TV or through the internet. It appears not even you have access to information about these types of criminals."
,Ryuk laughs and looks at Light.
Ryuk,He got you there.
,The scene changes between L's symbol and the hidden face of a man speaking into a microphone.
L,"But I assure you, L is real. I do exist. Now…try to kill me!"
,Scene change to Light's room.
Light,You…you bastard!
,Scene change to Japan National Police Agency headquarters. L still challenging Kira.
L,"What's wrong? Go ahead! Come on, right now! Kill me!"
Officer 1,What the hell is going on? L is taking this too far.
Officer 2,"Are you trying to kill yourself, L?!"
,"Scene change to the city center. People have gathered around large screen, listening to L's challenge."
Bystander 1,What's going on?
Bystander 2,"Look, it's Kira versus L!"
Bystander 3,Huh? What?
,The crowd begins to murmur.
Bystander 4,This is freaky.
Bystander 5,Amazing.
Bystander 6,"Do it, Kira!"
Bystander 7,"Someone, stop this!"
Bystander 8,What's the matter?!
,Scene change to Light's room.
L,Can't you do it?
,Light stares at the TV incredulously.
L,"Well Kira, it seems you can't kill me after all."
,"Ryuk laughs once again. Scene change to the man with the microphone, L."
L,So there are some people you can't kill. You've given me a useful hint.
,Scene change to Light's room.
L,"Let me return the favor. I'll tell you something that I think you'll find interesting. Although this was announced as a worldwide broadcast, the truth is, we are only broadcasting in the Kanto region of Japan. I had planned to broadcast this message around the world until we found you, but it looks like that won't be necessary. I know now where you are."
Ryuk,[Laughs] This L guy is pretty good.
L,"The police treated your first killing as an unrelated incident, but in actuality, the first of your victims was a suspect in Shinjuku."
,Flashback to the scene of the incident.
L,"Of all the criminals that recently died of heart attacks, this one's crime was, by far, the least serious. Furthermore, his crime was only ever reported inside Japan."
,Present day. Scene change to L's location.
L,"I used that information to deduce this much. You are in Japan and your first victim was little more than an experiment, which means you haven't been killing for very long."
,Light gasps. Scene change to the city center.
L,"We decided to broadcast in Kanto first because of its large population, and, luckily, we found you."
,Scene change to Japan National Police Agency headquarters.
L,"To be completely honest with you, I never expected that things would go this well, but…it won't be too long now before I am able to sentence you to death."
Matsuda,L has…certainly lived up to his reputation.
Soichiro,"Mmhmm. He proved that Kira exists, that the deaths were murders, and that he is here in Japan."
,Scene change to Light's room.
L,"Naturally, I am very interested to know how you're able to commit these murders without being present…but I don't mind waiting a little bit longer. [Scene change to L's location.] You can answer all of my questions when I catch you… Let's meet again soon, Kira."
,"Scene change to Light's room. The broadcast cuts out and leaves the screen snowy, a fuzzy sound filling the quiet room."
Light,"Really? He's gonna sentence me to death? Sounds interesting. I accept your challenge, L."
Ryuk,[Thinking] Each of them has to hunt down the other without knowing the other's name or face. And the first one whose identity is revealed will die. Humans are so much fun.
,The scene constantly changes between Light's room and L's location.
Light,L…
L,Kira…
,Split screen.
Both Light and L,I will hunt you down wherever you're hiding and I will eliminate you!
Light,I am…
L,I am…
Both,Justice!
,Ending credits
,Next episode preview
Light,"I'm not the one who's going to find L. I can let the police do that for me. And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him! Looks like I may be able to provide you with more entertainment, Ryuk."
,Opening chants
L,"Greetings to all of you at the ICPO. I…am L. Whether the guilty party is an individual or a group, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese."
Lind L. Tailor,"Kira, I've got a pretty good idea what your motivation might be, and I can guess what you hope to achieve. However, what you're doing right now is evil."
Light,You…you bastard.
L,Now…try to kill me!
Light,I am justice! I protect the innocent and those who fear evil! I'm the one who will become the god of a new world that everyone desires!
Officer 1 (talking over Light),What the hell is going on? L is taking this too far.
L (talking over Light),"Go ahead! Come on, right now! Kill me!"
Light,L…
L,Kira…

Both Light and L,"I will hunt you down wherever you're hiding, and I will eliminate you!"

Both,Justice!
,Task Force headquarters
Soichiro,All right. Let's start with the tip line reports.
Mogi,"Yes, sir. Up to this point, we've received three thousand twenty-nine responses about the murders via telephone and e-mail. Most of these have been curious citizens and prank calls, but there are fourteen people who claimed to either know Kira or who have seen him. All fourteen accounts were followed up on and carefully documented. However, nobody could provide any information that wasn't already publicly available. And lastly, this week there were additional twenty-one people who called in claiming to be Kira."
Soichiro,Huh. [Clears throat]
Mogi,We didn't wanna rule anything out. So we followed standard procedure and created files for all twenty-one of them.
Soichiro,Uh huh. All right. On to the victim reports.
Officer 2,"Yes, sir. Upon further investigation, we have confirmed that information of the heart attack victims was in fact publicly available in Japan immediately prior to their deaths. Also, concerning L's request that we investigate the time of death for each victim, we found that all of them occurred between the hours of 4 p.m. and 2 a.m. on weekdays, local time, with sixty-eight percent of them occurring between 8 p.m. and 12 a.m. Weekends and holidays appeared to be the exception to this rule as the times of deaths vary much more widely than during the week."
L,"[Through voice modifier] That information is extremely relevant for us. It suggests that, given the times of death, our suspect could very well be a student."
Soichiro,Hmm?
L,"Based on the fact that Kira is only killing criminals, I think it's safe to assume that he is driven by a very idealistic notion of justice. It's highly possible he may even aspire to be some sort of godlike figure. We're dealing with the individual who has a very childish concept of right and wrong. Of course, this is mere speculation at this point, but still, I recommend you re-examine any assumptions you've made as to whether or not our suspect could be a student. We must consider every possibility. I believe that's the shortest route to finding and arresting Kira. Please, continue with your report."
Soichiro,Hm. Oh right. Does anyone else have something they'd like to add?
Matsuda,"Um, yes sir."
Soichiro,"What is it, Matsuda?"
Matsuda,"Um…well I'm not saying this to support Kira or to condone the murders, but…in the last few days throughout the world, but especially here in Japan, we've observed the dramatic decrease in the number of violent crimes committed."
Soichiro,"Well, I suppose it makes sense. We've suspected something like that would happen. Anything else?"
Matsuda,No.
Soichiro,"Well, that about sums up our report for today. L?"
L,"Thank you, everyone. I feel we're one step closer to finding Kira. Before I go, I'm afraid I have one additional request to make. This is directed to the teams investigating the victims, TV news, and internet: I would like you to go back and take a closer look at the exact way in which the victims' identities were made public. Be as thorough as possible. In particular, I want to know if photos of the victims were made available to the public in Japan. I'll leave it to you."
Soichiro,[Stretching] Ah… ah…
Matsuda,Chief!
Soichiro,Hm?
Matsuda,You look like you could use one of these. Sleeping much?
Soichiro,Ah. Thank you. That'll do the trick. I feel all these late nights are starting to take their toll. [Sips coffee] Ah.
Matsuda,"About what I said earlier at our meeting…well, now that I think about it, um, I'm sure everyone already knew that. I wanted to apologize."
Soichiro,"What on earth are you talking about? Nobody said it'll be easy to speak the truth, but it has to be done. Especially when it is something that isn't easy to say."
Matsuda,Ha?
Soichiro,"Having said that, if you had gone on to say that we should commend Kira for doing such a great job of reducing violent crime, then yes, I might have had a little problem with that."
Matsuda,"Oh, no. No, I wouldn't. That would never happen!"
Soichiro,[Laughs] Just kidding.
,"Yagami household, in Light's bedroom"
Sayu,"I knew I can count on you, Light."
Light,"Hey, so do you think you're ready to try a few on your own now?"
Sayu,"Huh? Yeah. I guess so. Oh, sounds like Dad's home."
,Downstairs
Sachiko,"Welcome home, dear."
Soichiro,Thank you.
,Back in Light's room
Sayu,He's home really early today.
Light,"Hey, why don't you at least try the last problem by yourself?"
Sayu,"I will, but maybe after dinner."
,Sayu exits.
Light,"Yeah, right."
Ryuk,"Helping your sister with her homework, you sure are relaxed."
Light,"Of course. If the police try to come after me, I'm pretty confident I've got something that'll give me the advantage."
,Downstairs in the dining room
Light,"Hey, glad you can join us for dinner. You hungry, Dad?"
Soichiro,Yeah. It's been a long day.
,Scene change to Light's family eating dinner as Ryuk watches
Soichiro,"So, Light, tell me. How are your studies going?"
Light,"Hm? Everything's okay, I guess."
Sayu,Whatever. He's at the top of his class. My big brother is a genius!
Sachiko,"That's my son! We're all proud of you, Light."
Light,"Is everything okay, Dad? You look tired."
Soichiro,"Yeah. I'm not able to say too much about it, but this case I'm working on now is really tough."
,Light's room
Ryuk,"[Thinks] I see. Well, well. Daddy's a policeman. And that must be the reason why you're so confident?"
Light,"That's right. It's easy for me to hack into Dad's computer. We're on a home network, so I can copy the files I need without leaving a trace. This way, I can keep track of their investigation. Here we go. Well, isn't that interesting? Looks like the police are already beginning to suspect a student."
Ryuk,[Laughs] I guess that means you are in trouble.
Light,"If the cause of death is written within forty seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next six minutes and forty seconds. That sound right to you, Ryuk?"
Ryuk,So what's your point?
Light,"In other words, if I write heart attacks as the cause of death, then I should be able to write down all the details including time of death afterward, shouldn't I? Looks like I will be able to provide you with more entertainment now."
,"Scene changes to Light walking outside and then changes to a prison. An inmate is grunting and sticks his hand out of his cell, then dies. Light is then shown playing a soccer match, but it soon changes to another prison where several inmates are lined up."
Inmate,[Grunts]
Officer,"Inmate 148, what's wrong? Snap out of it!"
,Scene changes to Light taking his food out of a bad and opening his lunch while it cuts to another inmate ripping his shirt and gasping for air as he dies in the prison cafeteria.
,Task Force headquarters
Soichiro,What? I-I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?
Officer 1,Yes.
Soichiro,"The day before there were another twenty-three victims. He's killing one off, every hour on the hour."
Officer 2,Considering that this new pattern has been going on for two weekdays…
Officer 1,It does punch some holes in the theory that our suspect is a student.
Officer 3,Maybe not. Anybody can skip two days of school.
L,[Through voice modifier] You're missing the point.
Soichiro,Huh?
Task Force members,Huh?
L,"It does appear less likely now that Kira is a student, but that's not the message he's sending by doing this."
Matsuda,Ah!
L,"Ask yourselves, why every hour? And why are all these victims in prisons where they should be discovered immediately? Why not other criminals like before? I believe Kira is telling us that not only can he kill from a distance, but he can also determine the time of death. But something's not right. As soon as we began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed. As if to contradict that theory. Coincidence? No. Too convenient. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information. It's obvious now. This is a direct challenge to me."
,Light's room
Light,I'd say L is probably starting to sweat a little by now. What'll really make his job difficult is that I've deliberately left about fifty criminals alive for times like this.
Ryuk,Oh?
Light,"If L is as good as they say, by now, he should be starting to suspect someone with connections to the police."
,Unknown location
L,So Kira has found a way to obtain information from the Task Force headquarters. This is one fact that cannot be ignored. But what does he get out of all this? What is he hoping to achieve in the end?
,Light's room
Ryuk,There's one thing I don't get. Showing them you have connections to the police makes it easier for them to find you than when they just suspected you a student.
Light,"Well, my real agenda is…to get close to L, so I can eliminate him."
Ryuk,How are you gonna do that?
Light,"You still don't understand human beings. In this world, there are very few people who actually trust each other. And it's no different for the police, you know. What's especially important is that L and the investigators don't trust each other at all. Think about it. Could you trust someone whose name and face you don't even know? When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak. When that happens, it'll only be a matter of time before the police start resenting L. On the surface, it will appear that L and the investigation team are working together to try to catch me. But in reality, L will investigate the police, and they will be investigating L. I'm not the one who is going to find L. I can let the police do that for me. And when they do, that's when I'll eliminate him."
,Commercial break
,Task Force headquarters
Soichiro,What's this about?
Officer 1,"With all due respect, Chief, we are resigning."
Officer 2,"We demand that you assign us to a different case. Otherwise, you can have our badges right here and now."
Soichiro,Why? You're good cops!
Officer 1,"Isn't it clear? It's because we value our lives, sir."
Officer 2,"If what L says is true, Kira has some ESP-like power that somehow allows him to kill people indirectly from anywhere."
Officer 3,"Well, if I were Kira, sir, I'd probably wanna trying to get rid of the people who are trying to catch me."
Officer 2,"Let's face it, he knows he will be sentenced to death if he's caught."
Officer 1,"We all sat here and watched when L decided to pull that media stunt and challenge Kira to kill him. Well, it was all very impressive at the time, but then again, L never had to show his face or reveal his name for that matter. I'm sure you recall L's last request? He asked that we take a closer look at how these victims' identities were made public and specifically to determine whether photos of the victims were available to the public prior to their deaths. Well, it turns out he was right! Every single one of those victims' names and photos were broadcast to the Japanese public, and then they died! Unlike someone we know, we are out there investigating this case wearing police IDs with our names and photos on them! Anybody with a computer can find out who we are! We don't hide our faces! We're out in the open!"
Officer 3,"Sir, the truth is, we could be killed by Kira at any time."
Officer 1,"For these reasons, we refuse to continue working this case. Excuse us, Chief."
Soichiro,"Hey, stop! All of you, hold it right there!"
,"Scene change to L watching his computer screen, then Ryuk with Light in Daikoku Private Academy"
Ryuk,Huh?
Math professor,"In order to solve this problem, we must establish the concept that X squared equals large X. Now pay attention because this is important. Before we tackle more complex quadratic equations, we have to start thinking of large X's value as simply the multiple of two integers. Now let's apply this concept to our first problem."
,Unknown location
Watari,"We brought the FBI to Japan four days ago. They are fully operational. As requested, they're now gathering intel on the police."
L,And this is the complete list?
Watari,Yes.
L,"[Thinking] There are one hundred forty-one people in the police force who have access to classified information regarding the investigation. I am sure that somewhere in this list of the police officers and the people closest to them, we will find our suspect."
,"Streets, Light is walking and Ryuk is hovering beside him"
Ryuk,"Light, you got a second?"
Light,"I've already told you, Ryuk. You can't talk to me in public. How many times do I have to tell you?"
Ryuk,"In that case, I'll talk, you just listen. If you don't want to hear me, you can plug your ears or something. First of all, I don't have anything against you. I actually think the notebook couldn't have been picked up by a better person. I'm here 'cause I have to stick around till the Death Note is finished or I see you die, whichever comes first. But make no mistake, Light, I'm not on your side or L's side."
Light,"Yeah. Well, I knew that much already."
Ryuk,"You'll never hear me say anything about whether what you're doing is right or wrong. I'm not here to support you or give you my opinion. I'm just a spectator, but as your roommate, I might have a few things to say now and then."
Light,"What's this about, Ryuk? Why are you telling me all this stuff now, anyway? It's really not like you."
Ryuk,"It's just that I'm no ally of yours, or Kira's, if you prefer. The only reason I'm going to tell you this is because, personally, it is starting to creep me out."
Light,Get to the point already.
Ryuk,"[Laughs] You are being followed by another human. He's watching you right now. It's really starting to get on my nerves. I realize there's no way he can see me, but, because I'm always following behind you wherever you go, I feel like I'm constantly being watched."
Light,That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.
,Light's room
Light,"[Thinking] Who would be following me? Does this mean L is already starting to suspect the police? If he's gonna investigate the police, he'll need a lot of resources and manpower. Even if he has as many as fifty people on the case, I don't see how they could ever figure out that I'm Kira. I shouldn't look like anything other than your average high school senior. But the longer I let this person keep following me, the greater the chance is they'll figure out who I really am. Above all, I need my stalker's name. Once I figure that out, I can get rid of him for good."
Ryuk,"Light, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. What makes a Shinigami and a human who has a Death Note different? Well, there are two things. And why do Shinigami have to write the names of humans in their Death Notes? You got any ideas?"
Light,"Of course not. Why would I know that? You know, you sure are talkative today."
Ryuk,It's because we are able to take human lifespans for ourselves.
Light,"Huh? Wait, what do you mean by that?"
Ryuk,Let's say you have a human who is due to live until the age of sixty and a God of Death wrote that this person would die at forty. Sixty minus forty equals twenty. Now those twenty years taken from someone in the human world are added to that god of death's life.
Light,Huh.
Ryuk,"So it means that as long as we don't slack off, even if someone was to shoot us in the head, or stab us in the heart with a knife, a god of death cannot die. On the other hand, no matter how many names you write in your Death Note, your lifespan will not increase. That is the first difference between gods of death and humans who possess a Death Note."
Light,[Laughs] That's something about Shinigami that I haven't heard before. Pretty interesting stuff.
Ryuk,The second difference between us will probably be of even greater interest to you. Though this has less to do with lengthening life and more to do with cutting it short.
Light,What do you mean cutting it short?
Ryuk,"Shinigami can tell what the person's name is by just looking at their face. We know instantly. And do you have any idea why? Because through a Shinigami's eyes, a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see their lifespan as well."
Light,Their name and lifespan?
Ryuk,"That's right. I'm able to see your name and lifespan right now. If I converted that to human time, I could tell you how many years you got left. But there's no way I'd ever tell you that. I may have a big mouth, but even I wouldn't go that far. [Laughs] Shinigami never have to worry that they won't be able to kill a person just because they don't know their name, and every time we do take a life, we always know exactly how many years we are going to receive. Our eyes just aren't the same, and that is the difference between you and I. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami, but only if a deal is made, one that has been with us since ancient times."
Light,And what's the deal?
Ryuk,The price for having the Shinigami's eyes…is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is.
Light,Half of my remaining lifespan?
Ryuk,"Yeah. In other words, if you are supposed to live another fifty years, it'll be twenty-five. If it was one more year, then six months."
Light,"I see. And since you've made it clear you're not on anyone's side, you won't help me out. You wouldn't just give me the names of people I want to kill. Basically, you're saying that I can't simply borrow your powers. I'd have to pay for them."
Ryuk,"That's right. It's a key part of the code that all Shinigami are bound by. I'll say this once more. Give me half your remaining lifespan, and I'll give you the Shinigami Eyes."
Light,"If I agree, I'll be able to know everyone's name just by looking at them. If I had that power, the Death Note would only be easier to use."
Ryuk,"So, what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?"
,Ending credits
,Next episode preview
Light,Everything has turned out exactly as I wrote it in the Death Note to the last detail. 11:45 on the dot. Everything is going just as I planned. The Death Note never fails.
,Opening Theme
,A montage of scenes from the previous episode plays as relevant dialogue from the episode overlaps
,A hand reaches out of a prison cell.
,Cut to a prison cafeteria. An inmate sitting at a table tears his shirt open and dies.
,"Cut to Soichiro standing at his desk in task force HQ, addressing two reporting officers."
Soichiro,[V.O.] What? I don't believe this. Another twenty-three victims yesterday? Are these confirmed?
,L's voice is heard as the screen dissolves to a room in an unknown location. L is leaning back in front of a computer.
L,"[V.O.] As soon as began to suspect that Kira might be a student, the pacing of the killings changed, as if to contradict that theory. This can only mean that Kira has access to police information."
,"Towards the end of L's first sentence, cut to: Light Yagami's bedroom. Light is sitting at his desk and using his computer."
Light,"[V.O.] When L discovers that I'm somehow getting confidential information, he'll be obligated to start investigating the police to find the source of the leak."
,"Towards the end of Light's last sentence, cut to neighborhood streets at night. Ryuk is hovering behind Light, who is walking down the middle of the street."
Ryuk,[V.O.] You're being followed by another human. He's watching you right now.
Light,[V.O.] That's a problem. I'll have to get rid of him as soon as possible.
,Cut to Light's bedroom at night
Ryuk,"Because through a Shinigami's eyes a human's name can be seen above their head. Not only that, we see there lifespan as well. However, if a Shinigami drops his Death Note, and a human picks it up, he can grant that human the eyes of a Shinigami. The price for having a Shinigami's eyes is half of that person's remaining lifespan. That's all it is. So... what'll it be, Light? Is it a deal?"
,Title card
,"Cut to: Shinigami Realm. The scene starts with a closeup of Shinigami 1, who is staring at the sky. The Shinigami's voices echo as they speak."
Shinigami 1,Has anyone seen Ryuk around?
,Cut out to the rest of the Shinigami Realm and the Shinigami sitting around. Pan across various Shinigami as they speak.
Shinigami 2,Maybe he was serious about losing his Death Note.
Shinigami 3,[O.S.] It was probably picked up by some human before he could get to it.
Shinigami 4,No way. Then he'd be stuck there 'til the end of that human's life or until the Death Note was destroyed. That could take a while.
Armonia Justin Beyondormason,Yeah. I can't picture Ryuk doing something so boring.
Shinigami 5,[O.S.] Do you know what? I actually heard he was carrying two Death Notes.
Shinigami 6,"[O.S.] Seriously, why would he need two?"
Armonia Justin Beyondormason,Beats me. I'll never understand that guy.
,"Fade from black: Human World, Light Yagami's bedroom; a continuation of Light and Ryuk's conversation seen in the intro recap."
Light,"So the price for receiving the eyes of the Shinigami is no more than half of my remaining lifespan? [pauses] That's it, right?"
Ryuk,"Yes. Well then, do we have a deal or not?"
,"Silence as Ryuk and Light stare at each other. Still grinning, Light narrows his eyes."
Light,Ryuk. [pauses] This deal is... out of the question.
Ryuk,Huh?
,Cut to the neighborhood outside. The moon shines in the sky and the streets are empty. The sounds of wind and a dog barking in the background.
Light,"Let's get this straight. [cut back] My plan is to create an ideal new world free from evil and all criminals, and I intend to reign as a god in that new world for a very long time. I might consider the deal if it lengthened my life, but not if I die sooner. I figured you of all people should know I wouldn't take this deal."
Ryuk,"Yeah. I still felt I should tell you that the deal existed, just in case. Anyway, I've done my part. I don't need you complaining I didn't tell you this earlier on."
Light,"This is what you call ""telling me early on""? Doncha you think you're a little late? I don't see why you couldn't'a told me this when we met. Or better yet, you could've simply included it in the instructions for the Death Note."
Ryuk,"Uh, good point. [thinking] He's not the slightest bit daunted by the fact that I'm a Shinigami. He doesn't suck up to me, and he seems to have no problem giving me a hard time."
,Cutaway of a Stranger standing behind a streetlight outside looks back at the Yagami house before turning away. Cut back.
Light,"[getting up from his desk and walking away] Well, you sure there's nothing else you want to tell me ""ahead of time,"" [pauses as he lays back onto his bed] ""Shinigami""?"
Ryuk,"No, nothing else. [thinking] Eh, probably."
Light,Really? That's too bad.
Ryuk,Whaddya mean?
Light,"You know, Ryuk, I might've seriously considered the deal if you'd offered me wings instead of eyes. Just the idea of flying 'round freely in the sky sounds very god-like. After all, it's been mankind's dream since antiquity to be able to fly."
Ryuk,[slightly surprised] You'd stand out if you sprouted wings and flew around. Not to mention the police would have no trouble finding you.
Light,"[laughs softly] I was only joking. Anyway, if I keep bargaining for eyes and wings and whatever else, next thing you know I'm going to end up becoming a real Shinigami. Though who knows? I bet that could be pretty interesting."
Ryuk,"I wouldn't worry. Even without the eyes and wings, you're already a worthy Shinigami."
,Fade from black to Shinigami Realm. Various shots of different Shinigami and the surroundings as Ryuk speaks.
Ryuk,"[V.O.] The Shinigami realm is slowly rotting. We lead meaningless and empty lives. And the only reason we still take human lives is because we're afraid to die ourselves. The truth of the matter is that we no longer even know why we exist. In fact, I doubt there's any reason for our existence at all."
,Fade to black. Cut back to Light's bedroom
Ryuk,"[cont'd] What I'm saying is, compared to that, you're becoming a much more impressive Shinigami."
Light,"I don't know about that. I mean, from what you're telling me it, it sounds like I'm doing a lot more work than they are, but uh I don't want to be compared to a Shinigami. I'm a human using this Death Note to make the world a better place for humans. [flips through the Death Note] But I wouldn't necessarily say the Shinigami realm is meaningless to humans either."
Ryuk,Huh? Why do you say that?
Light,"Well, just think about it. Whenever a Shinigami like you comes to the human world once ever hundred—no more like every thousand years—the human world changes dramatically. The existence of the Shinigami Realm is extremely significant."
Ryuk,Really?
Light,"And you told me just now that the Shinigami realm is slowly rotting, right? Well, when you return from this world, why not use what you've learned here to try and change it for the better?"
Ryuk,"[after a pause] Well, Light, I'm not sure why I never noticed this until now, but you're quite the positive thinker."
Light,"[laughs softly] Yeah, of course I am. That's why I'm using the Death Note to create a better world. You have to be a positive thinker to even attempt something like this."
,Light gasps. He has turned the page to the rules written on the back of the cover.
Light,[cont'd] That's it. I got it.
Ryuk,Got what? What's this about?
Light,I think I just figured out how to find out the name of the guy who was following me today.
Ryuk,How're ya gonna do that?
Light,"I'm gonna use the rules of the Death Note to my advantage. I already know that if I write down a cause of death, I've got six minutes and forty seconds to record the conditions and exact time of death. First, I need to know exactly how far I can go in terms of specifying the details of death. ...This should be interesting."
,"Cut to: Central Government Building No. 2. White kanji reading ""next morning"" fades in. A phone rings."
,Cut to the task force headquarters inside. Soichiro picks up the phone. He occasionally pauses to listen to the person on the other end of the line.
Soichiro,"Yeah, it's me. ...Another six inmates were found dead last night? ...All were heart attacks? It's him... What? [an officer gasps] Bizarre behavior before they died? Could you be more specific? What do you mean? So they didn't just die from heart attacks."
,"Cut to the people on the other end of the line. Two men sit at a desk, and one slides a paper over to the man on the phone."
Caller,"No, what I'm saying is they all died of heart attacks, but it wasn't quite that simple."
,"Cut to the desk's surface with closeups of the evidence the Caller is going through. As he reports the deaths, he shifts through the evidence pertaining to each. The first piece of evidence is a photo of a cell with a bloody pentagram painted on the wall."
Caller,"[cont'd] Before one of them died, he drew a pentagram on the wall of his cell with his own blood. [letter] Another left a letter, but it doesn't seem to be a will or anything meaningful. [photo] As for the third victim, he escaped from his cell and ran all the way to the staff bathrooms before he died."
,"Cut to: L's location. The desktop on the floor beeps. L, his face cut off, off walks over and kneels in front of it. There's a beep as he pulls up a video chat window showing Watari' shadowed figure."
L,"What is it, Watari?"
Watari,"[muffled output] Three more heart attack victims, but the circumstances of their deaths are different from what we've seen thus far."
L,"What do you mean by ""different""?"
Watari,[muffled output] I'm sending you a copy of a letter as well as pictures taken at the scene.
L,Okay.
,There is beeping as images of the previously seen evidence appear on the computer monitor. L pauses to read the letter.
L,"It sounds like he was afraid that Kira would fine him. It's believable that our victim might have been genuinely afraid and wrote this, but... We know Kira can control the time of death. What if he can also determine the actions in the moments leading up to death? In which case..."
,Cut to task force headquarters at that same moment
L,[distorted by voice changer] Here.
Soichiro,[standing up] Huh?
L,"[distorted] We can't release details of these men's deaths to the media. As far as they're concerned, these are just heart attacks."
Soichiro,Huh...
L,"[distorted] I have reason to believe that Kira was performing some kind of ""test"" using these criminals. And if that's the case, we'd only be giving him the results of this information if we put it public."
Soichiro,Right. I understand.
Officer 1,So now he's experimenting on his victims?
Officer 2,Horrible.
Soichiro,"He's playing with people's lives, as if all this was just a game. It's unforgivable."
,Cut to L's location
L,If Kira is really using criminals as test subjects... what is he trying to achieve?
,Fade to black
,Cut to: Light's bedroom. Light is at his computer. The computer beeps as he pulls up an image of the previously seen picture of the bloody pentagram on the prison wall.
Light,"Look at this, Ryuk. I think we're in luck. The results of yesterday's little ""test"" of ours has been downloaded onto my dad's computer. And these results are just as I suspected. The Death Note will work for what I have in mind."
Ryuk,Whaddya mean by that?
,"""Light's Theme"" plays"
,"Split screen. The left half shows Light, and the right half starts as black, then fades into the previously seen image of the picture of a dead criminal on the floor."
Light,One of 'em escaped and ran into the bathroom I had specified in the Death Note.
,"Light's half cuts away to a closeup of a page in the Death Note that has the instructions of death written down, which includes a drawing of a pentagram. The other half of the screen is replaced with the previous image of the picture of a prison cell with a pentagram painted on the wall in blood."
Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] Another one drew the same symbol I had drawn in the bathroom before he died. And finally [the half of the screen with the cell is replaced with the previously seen letter] a third wrote the same letter I had written in the Death Note, word for word."
,Cut to black and fade in back to Light's bedroom
Light,"[cont'd] All three did exactly what I intended them to do. For the other three inmates, I purposely wrote conditions that were virtually impossible."
Ryuk,Huh?
,"Cut to closeup of the Death Note with corresponding text filled-in dissolves into the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Various images, including relevant, filled-in Death Note pages; diagrams; and images of the dead criminals appear in various split screen positions as Light explains his experiments."
Light,"With the first one, I wrote that he would die in front of the Eiffel Tower in one hour. However, everyone knows it's physically impossible to go from a prison in Japan to Paris, France in only one hour. Since this couldn't happen, he simply died of a heart attack in prison. The next was supposed to draw an exact picture of L's face on the prison wall. This also didn't happen. You can't draw someone you've never seen before."
Ryuk,[O.S.] Makes sense.
,Fade to black and cut to closeup of the Death Note with the third tested death written in the corner.
Light,"[V.O.] With the last one, I tried something slightly different. I specified that he would write a note that read, ""I know that L is suspicious of the Japanese police."""
,Cut back to Light
Light,"[cont'd] To be honest, I actually expected this one to work, but it didn't end up happening. Which means, it's impossible to make someone write what they don't already know. Or at the very least, it has to be the kind of thing they could come up with on their own. Basically, even the Death Note can't do the impossible, but as long as it's within the realistic limits of what that person might do, I can control them as much as I want before they die."
Ryuk,That's very clever. But what's all this leading to? What's the point?
Light,"These latest victims will no doubt keep L and the police guessing. Even as we speak, he's probably trying to decipher all the clues I left for him. Especially that little note. That absolutely meaningless dying message."
,"Cut to: L's location. L is crouching in front of a computer, the light of the monitor being the only thing illuminating the room."
L,"If Kira used those criminals to start an experiment of some sort, it means he's about to start something. If he moves now, there's a good chance the FBI will notice someone acting. But perhaps he has a different goal in mind altogether."
,"Cut to computer monitor, with images of the pentagram and letter pictures pulled up next to each other"
L,[cont'd] [O.S.] Could the pentagram and this letter be some kind of message?
,"Cut back to L; ""Light's Theme"" comes to an abrupt stop and L gasps. Cut to a closeup of the letter on the monitor, followed by a shrill as the first row of the letter is highlighted.]"
L,[cont'd] [O.S.] Is this it?
,"Brief pre-lap; as Light says the first word of his sentence, cut to: Light's room in the daytime. Light is working at his computer."
Light,Alright. Time for the real thing.
Ryuk,"""Real thing""?"
Light,Yesterday on the news they said this drug addict tried to rob a bank but was unsuccessful.
,"Cut to the bottom of Light's computer monitor. As Light speaks, pan up until the monitor reveals a picture of the criminal mentioned on the news. Under the picture is kanji reading ""????? (wanted criminal) ????? (Kiichiro Osoreda)."
Light,[cont'd] [O.S.] He attacked a few people and then ran away emptyhanded. I'll use him.
,"Cut to Light, who pulls out his cellphone and starts punching in numbers"
Light,"[cont'd] It's kinda last minute, but I'm sure I can find someone. I got a few people in mind."
Ryuk,"""A few people."" For what?"
Light,"You'll see. [putting phone to his ear] Believe it or not, I'm actually a rather popular guy, Ryuk."
,"Cut to exterior of an unknown house; the sound of a cell phone ringing. Cut to a room inside; a girl (Yuri) lying in bed grabs her ringing cellphone and picks it up, remaining buried under the covers. She occasionally pauses while Light talks on the other end."
Yuri,"Hello? ...Huh? Light? Oh, morning."
,"Eyecatch out – ""The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell."""
,"Eyecatch in – ""If the time of death is written within 40seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated, and the time can go into effect within 40seconds after writing the name."""
,Cut to: an outdoor public area; there are various people scattered about. Light is walking down a stairway. Light glances back to check that the Stranger is still following him.
Light,[thinking] He's still following me. This whole thing would just be a waste of time if he wasn't following me.
,"Cut to Yuri at the bus stop, standing under a bus shelter. She is looking at her cellphone. A bus drives by. Yuri looks up as Light approaches in the distance. Ryuk is flying behind him."
Yuri,[waving] [calls out] Light!
Ryuk,A date?
Light,Yeah.
,"Yuri is still under the bus shelter, waving at Light. She laughs happily."
Light,[cont'd] It's a date no matter how you look at it. I'm sure even my stalker will see it that way.
Ryuk,"But this isn't just a date, is it? You said that you'd figured out a way o find your stalkers name. So tell me, what do you plan on doing?"
Light,"Huh? Come on, didn't you see what I wrote in the Death Note? I explained it in great detail."
Ryuk,No. Doing that would take all the fun out of it.
Light,"In that case, just be patient and watch what happens. [he approaches the bus shelter; to Yuri:] Sorry, did I keep you waiting?"
Yuri,"No, not at all. Anyway, I haven't been to Space Land since junior high! [clings to Light's arm] I'm so excited. And the best part is I have you all to myself!"
Light,"Uh, yeah."
,The Stranger is watching them in the shadows behind a nearby stairway
Stranger,[thinking] During the week he goes to school and cram school at night.
,Light and Yuri are talking and laughing as the Stranger thinks.
Stranger,"[cont'd] [thinking] Dates on his day off. Normal kid, just a hardworking senior in high school. Chief Yagami's son, Light Yagami. [Stranger jots down notes in small notebook] No cause for suspicion."
,"The Stranger looks up. The sound of a bus stopping, and then Light and Yuri are seen stepping onto the bus. The stranger walks towards the bus."
Stranger,"[cont'd] [thinking] At any rate, I'll be done with my surveillance today, and that'll be it."
,Dissolve to some point later on. Light and Yuri are sitting at a seat on the bus.
Yuri,"I don't get it, Light. Didn't you say you weren't going out until entrance exams were over?"
,"Towards the end of her sentence, the Stranger walks passed her and Light and sits in the seat behind them"
Light,That was before I scored number one on the national practice exams.
Yuri,[groans] [playfully] You're such a nerd. [giggles]
,"Dissolve to some point later on. Music plays and there are shots of various people on the bus. Yuri talking noiselessly, the Stranger sitting behind her and Light, Light with his eyes closed."
,"Cut to aerial view of a bus stop, where one man waits. The bus pulls up and stops, and the music comes to a calm end before cutting back to the interior of the bus. The man enters; it is the man from the article previously seen on Light's computer: Kiichiro Osoreda. He walks towards the front of the bus, and Light has taken notice of him."
Light,"[thinking] It's him. He's here. Seven passengers excluding him, no one's in the way. Everything should go smoothly."
,"Osoreda cocks his gun, then points it at the bus driver (Sasaki), who gasps. Osoreda addresses everyone on the bus."
Osoreda,Stay in your seats unless you want to die.
,A woman makes small a small cry in fear
Stranger,[thinking] A bus jacking? You gotta be kidding me.
Osoreda,"Everybody shut up! If anybody moves, I'm putting a bullet in their head. [to Sasaki] Alright, driver, you listen to me. I know you've got the number for Space Land's office on ya. Call 'em!"
Sasaki,O-okay.
,"Cut to the front wheel of the bus, which is still spinning as it continues down the road."
Sasaki,"[on the phone] This-this is Sasaki, calling from Bus 1-7-4. [cut back]"
Osoreda,"Tell 'em what's going on—and no tricks, either."
Sasaki,"M-my bus has been hijacked, and he's holding a gun to my head."
Osoreda,[grabbing phone from Sasaki] Gimme that. [on the phone] You heard what he said. Now you listen up!
,"Still holding the phone to his face, Osoreda turns and points his gun at the bus passengers."
Osoreda,"Have a female staff member bring all the cash from Space Land's cash from yesterday. I know it's there. Have her meet us two bus stops from the park and don't make me wait. If you try to mess with me at all or try to get the police involved, I swear I'll kill everyone one of these passengers."
,"Yuri is quaking in fear, her hands clasped, and her eyes shut tight. Light taps her thigh, and she opens her eyes and looks at him."
Yuri,Huh?
,Light holds up a small piece of paper for her to see. His voice is heard saying what's written on the note.
Light,"[V.O.] Yuri, don't be scared. As soon as he turns around, I'm going to grab the gun out of his hand."
,"Light purposely held the note so that the Stranger could also see. Having read the note, the Stranger leans forward to talk to Light. Light and Yuri look back at him when he starts talking."
Stranger,"Don't be stupid. That's risky. [leans closer] If it comes to that, I'll take care of it."
,Light looks away and starts writing on the paper
Stranger,"It's okay. We don't have to pass notes back and forth. As long as we keep it down, he won't be able to hear our voices over the sound of the engine."
,Light crumples up the paper and stuffs it into his pocket.
Light,Do you have any proof you're not his accomplice? Why should we trust you?
,The Stranger gasps and stiffens
Yuri,[timidly] Accomplice?
Light,"Yes, I've read about this before. The first hijacker comes in like he's working alone. Meanwhile, the second one pretends to be a hostage and stays in the very back just in case something goes wrong. [softly] What's the matter."
Yuri,[softly] You... you really think he is one?
Stranger,"[thinking] I... I have no choice. I'm sure Light Yagami isn't Kira. If he was, he could just kill this guy with a heart attack."
,He hands Light his wallet containing his FBI badge and ID
Stranger,Here's my proof. [Light takes it] Take a look.
,Light holds up the wallet and looks at the ID
Light,"[thinking] FBI? I see. L needed an outsider, so he got the FBI to investigate anyone connected to the Japanese Police Force. His name is... Raye Penber."
,"Light grins, then quickly composes himself and hands the Stranger—Raye Penber—back his ID"
Light,I trust you. And I guess for the time being I won't bother asking what an FBI agent is doing on the bus in the first place. Do you have a gun?
Raye,"Yeah, I've got one."
Light,"So if it comes down to it, I can rely on you, right?"
Raye,Yes.
,"Osoreda approaches an elderly couple. The man gasps, and the woman whimpers in fear, leaning into her husband."
Osoreda,"Get the hell up, you old hag! You want me to shoot you right now?"
Raye,[gasps] [thinking] That's right. This guy. His face was all over the local news just a few days ago.
,"Raye's thoughts continue over Osoreda, who says the following"
Osoreda,"Look at me when I'm talking to you, grandma! I said shut up! [growls]"
Raye,[cont'd] [thinking] Some junkie. He tried to rob a bank and then killed three people before he got away. He's extremely dangerous.
Light,"[smugly thinking] We're safe. He won't shoot us. In fact, he's not gonna do anything."
,"Light purposely makes a crumpled-up note fall out of his pocket and onto the floor. He leans down to pick it up, gasping in fake concern. Osoreda notices and points his gun at Light."
Osoreda,"[shouting] Don't move, you little punk!"
,Light looks up at Osoreda
Osoreda,"[shouting] What the hell is that? [pause] Eh, smartass! [picking up note] You guys were planning something back here, weren'cha?"
Raye,"[thinking] Damn it! If he sees that note from before, he'll find out that Light was planning to jump him and take his gun away!"
,Osoreda silently reads the note. It is not the paper from earlier. Date plans are written on the note in kanji.
Osoreda,"Pft. Plans for a date, huh? [crumples and tosses note to Light] Stupid kid."
,"He turns around to look at Light, crumples the note and walks away. Light smirks slightly and tightens his grip on the crumpled paper."
Light,[thinking] Gotcha.
,"The engine of the bus briefly roars as the bus goes under a bridge. The music shifts to something dark and sinister, the bus is dark for a moment, with Ryuk's shadow visible. Once things return to normal, Osoreda turns around to look at the passengers."
Osoreda,Huh?
,"His eyes widens, and he gasps. He breathes heavily and panic and backs up, pulling out his gun, cocking it, and pointing it. From now on, he shouts, his voice frantic."
Osoeda,[shouting frantically] Wh-who the hell are you? You in the very back? What do you think you're doing?
,"Raye Penber, his hand reaching in his coat for a gun, inhales sharply and his eyes widen"
Osoreda,[shouting frantically] Don't mess with me!
,Ryuk is now visible in the back of the bus
Osoreda,[shouting frantically] How long have you been hiding back there?
Ryuk,What's this? [tilts head] You're talking to me? [steps forward] So you mean you can actually see me right now?
Osoreda,"[gasps] Stay there, you! You—Keep away from me, you freak!"
Raye,[thinking] This isn't good. He's hallucinating! [quickly leans forward] [shouting] Everyone! Get down!
,"The passengers gasp and scream as they brace themselves. Light grabs Yuri and pulls her down with him, leaning forward. Ryuk is hit with realization. "
Ryuk,"Oh, I get it! That little note that Light ""accidentally"" dropped, was actually torn from the pages of the Death Note itself. Since he tricked this guy into TOUCHING the paper, he's the only other one on the bus who can see me. [walking towards Osoreda] That's so smart!"
Osoreda,[stumbling back] [shouting frantically] Get away!
,"He takes two shots at Ryuk, letting out cries each time. The first shot misses Ryuk and goes through a window, and the second goes through him."
Soichiro,"Sorry, pal. I'm a Shinigami, so I'm afraid your bullets aren't gonna kill me."
,"Osoreda screams and shoots Ryuk five times. Each bullet goes through Ryuk, and the fifth shatters the window at the back of the bus. Osoreda's screams die down, and he continues to pull the trigger but is out of bullets. He stops pulling the trigger but continues to point the gun at Ryuk. His frantic gasps of fear continue and can be heard under Ryuk's dialogue."
Ryuk,"""Anyone who touches the Death Note can see me."" ""I have to stay 'til the Death Note is finished or you die—whichever comes first."" And ""a Shinigami can't die from being shot."" I've said all these things at one time or another. Well, he is the top-ranked student in the country. [Raye gets up from his seat and runs forward] He even used this hijacking as a way to get the guy following him to willingly give up his name."
,"Raye runs past Ryuk and towards Osoreda. Osoreda runs forward, panting, then stops behind Sasaki, wrapping his arms around him"
Osoreda,Stop the bus. [shouting] Let me off!
,"The bus screeches to a stop, tilting and hitting the curb. The door opens and Osoreda runs out onto the street, falling to his knees. The sinister music comes to a stop. Tires can be heard screeching against pavement. Osoreda turns his head and sees a car attempting to come to a halt. The screen cuts away to a building, and the crashing of the car is heard. Everything is silent."
,"After a pause, cut back to the bus. Raye is standing at the open door of the bus, shocked. Sasaki is next to him, staring horrified. Yuri is looking out the window with an almost blank expression. Two other passengers look out the window in shock. After a moment, Light pulls down his coat sleeve and looks at his watch."
Light,[thinking] Eleven forty-five on the dot. Everything went just as I planned.
,Cut to black. Fade into the image of Kiichiro Osoreda's wanted image on Light's computer monitor.
Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] ""Kiichiro Osoreda. Accidental death."""
,Cut to scene with aerial view of Osoreda at bus station. A montage of scenes from the incident before superimposes an image of the filled-out Death Note entry on Osoreda's death.
Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] ""Boards the 11:31 Space Land-bound bus near the eastern entrance to the park, holding a loaded gun, and attempts to hijack the bus. He sees a horrific phantom and empties his gun trying to kill it. Terrified, he leaves the bus. Immediately afterwards, at 11:45, he dies when struck by a car."""
,Freeze frame of Osoreda's face as he stares at the approaching car. Fade to black. Fade in from black to a closeup of the pavement. Osoreda's hand is visible and his blood flows on the pavement.
Light,"[cont'd] [thinking] The Death Note never fails. [cut to Raye] You will be next, Raye Penber."
,Cut to previous shot of Osoreda's hand on the bloody pavement.
,"""TO BE CONTINUED"""
,Next episode preview
Light,"[V.O.] It's just as I thought. He doesn't suspect me at all. The remaining investigators will all die of heart attack. Farewell, Raye Penber."
,Ending credits
,Opening Theme
,Title card
,"Cut in: streets in an unknown location. White text reading ""12?20? AM11:50 (December 20th, 11:50 A.M.)"" fades in. A man next to his car is on a cell phone. Kiichiro Osoreda lies in a pool of blood a few yards away. The bus is in the background nearby. Raye Penber is standing next to the bus, staring at Osoreda's body. Light walks off the bus."
Raye,You there.
Light,Yeah?
Raye,"Listen carefully: I came to Japan as a part of a secret investigation, so the local police can't find out that, um... that I."
Light,I understand. I promise I won’t tell anyone that I met you and of course [pauses] that includes my father.
Raye,"[sighs softly in relief] Well then, [runs away] please excuse me."
Light,"[thinking] It's just as I thought. Anyway, I don't want the police to know that I've come into contact with an FBI agent, either. If my father ever found out, there's no doubt he'd let L know. [brief shot of Raye Penber] It's obvious that he doesn't suspect me. And as for the police, I'm sure they'll treat this as just another unfortunate accident."
,"As Light finishes his thought, dissolve to: exterior of a hotel. Cut to a room inside, where a Woman is reading a book. She flips pages, and after a moment, there is the sound of a door opening. She looks up and lets out a small gasp."
Woman,"[gladly] Hey, welcome back."
,Raye lets out a sigh as he tosses his jacket onto a large bed.
Raye,[wearily] What a day.
,The Woman stands up
Woman,"Raye, what's the matter? Something happened, didn't it? [walking towards nearby shelf] I've never heard you sigh like that."
,"His eyes closed, Raye leans back in a chair and loosens his tie. The Woman starts looking through the shelves to prepare a drink."
Raye,"Yeah. The bus I was on got hijacked, if you can believe it."
,The Woman stops what she's doing and turns to Raye
Woman,[shocked] A bus jacking?
Raye,"Some junkie. Robbed a bank two days ago, and I guess he wanted to try taking on a bus today. I didn't think this kind of thing happened here."
,The Woman resumes her task as she speaks.
Woman,So you were already on the bus when the hijacker got on it?
Raye,"Yeah, and in the end the guy freaked out, jumped out of the bus, and got hit by a car."
,"The woman, having gone to get ice from the ice bucket, goes still. There is a moment of silence before she finally speaks."
Woman,Did he die?
Raye,"Yeah, probably. I couldn’t really sick are and see what happened to him."
,"The Woman walks over to him with two cups of tea, stopping in front of him"
Raye,[cautiously] What do you mean?
Woman,"Think about it. You got on that bus because you were investigating someone, right? And now you're telling me that this criminal is most likely dead. Doesn't that suggest that you—"
Raye,[interrupting] That's enough.
,"The Woman's eyes widen, and she gasps"
Raye,"[increasingly frustrated]Look, darling, you and I know you used to be one of the best agents in the FBI. But now you’re my fiancé now. I mean, we talked about this. You're not an agent anymore, so just leave it alone."
Woman,[after a pause] But...
Raye,"[frustratedly] You wouldn't get involved with the Kira care and you wouldn't do anything dangerous. That's what you promised when we decided you’d come with me, so I could meet your parents in Japan. You do remember that, don't you?"
Woman,"[disheartened] Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just force of habit. Sorry about that."
Raye,"No, I should be sorry. Let's... forget about it. [happily] Anyway, once we have a few kids running around, you'll probably be so busy you'll forget you were ever an agent. Your mind will be occupied with better things, too."
,After a moment she smiles and chuckles softly
Raye,"[cont'd] More importantly, tell me how I can convince your dad I'm worthy of his daughter. Kira doesn't scare me half as much as he does."
,The woman chuckles
,"Cut to: Yagami house exterior at night. After a brief pre-lap, cut inside to Light's room. Light is sitting at his desk, holding a pen. The Death Note is lying on the desk, opened up to two blank pages."
Ryuk,"Oh, let me guess. You're about to write down the name of that agent, aren't you? The one from the bus."
Light,"Not yet. I'm gonna wait one week before writing his name. If he dies right after meeting me, I'll only draw attention to myself. I'll write his name in here once they've had time to investigate more people with ties to the police. It'll be less obvious that way. In the meantime, I think I'll use some of those inmates I've been keeping alive to play around with L a little more."
,"Cut to: L's location. There's a closeup of speaker, followed by a beeping sound signaling that Watari has connected to L and is communicating over video chat."
Watari,[muffled output] L.
L,[turning to the computer] Hmm?
Watari,Another victim. This one left what appears to be a suicide note.
,L turns around and walks towards the computer
L,"Please, send it to me."
,"The computer beeps as an image of the note appears on the screen, which also has a window of Watari pulled up. The first row of text in the letter is highlighted. L is sitting in front of the computer, looking at the screen. He reads the three words."
L,"""Gods of Death."""
,"An image of a row of text from a similar, a previously seen letter, as well as the current row, briefly appear split screen as L puts the two phrases together"
L,"""L, did you know, Gods of Death...?"" Is he trying to tell us that Gods of Death exist? [to Watari:] Listen, Watari. Tell the police to monitor prison populations closely for the next few days. Kira may use other suicide notes to communicate us."
Watari,[muffled output] Understood.
,"Fade to black. Cut to: the above stairway entrance to a train. White text reading, ""12?27? PM3:00 (December 27th, 3:00 P.M.)"" fades in. Ambient noise which gets louder after cutting to the train below, the text disappearing with the cut. Light is dressed INCONSPICUOUSLY, leaning against a brick wall next to Ryuk."
Ryuk,This place is crawling with humans. How're ya gonna do it here?
Light,[scanning the crowd] Let's just say you're about to see the results of all the research and experiments I've been doing over the last few days.
Ryuk,Experiments?
Light,Yeah. I've been using known criminals who live in this part of town to test out different killing methods. I've learned a lot about the Death Note.
,Fade in from black to a filled-out Death Note page
Light,"[cont'd] [V.O.] For example, if I write a cause of death and the circumstances leading up to it, I can add a name afterwards and it'll still happen."
,Cut back
Ryuk,[thinking] Ooooh. Even I didn't know that one.
,Light straightens up
Light,[putting hood on] He's here. [pauses as Raye approaches] Right on time.
,"Raye passes Light and Ryuk, and once he is a few feet ahead, Light starts to follow him. Throughout their interaction Light speaks just loudly enough for Raye to hear him."
Light,Mr. Raye Penber.
,Raye immediately stops and begins to turn his head to look at Light
Light,Turn around and your dead.
,Raye looks forward
Light,I am Kira.
,Raye stiffens and gasps. The music shifts. Raye takes a shallow breath.
Light,[cont'd] That's right. Don't turn around or put your hands in your pockets. I won't hesitate to kill you here.
Raye,[thinking] I-it couldn't be. This voice. I've heard it somewhere.
Light,"But first, I'm gonna prove to you that I'm Kira. Do you see the man working over there at the coffee shop?"
,"Raye turns his head to look at a nearby coffee shop. An employee is standing at the entrance, sweeping."
Light,"That's right, the one sweeping the floor. I'm gonna kill him just for you."
Ryuk,But how? ...Don't do it.
,"The employee grunts, drops the broom, and grips at his chest before collapsing. Raye gasps. A crowd gathers around the dead man."
Light,"I'm afraid I had no choice but to kill him. I figured if I didn't kill at least one person, you wouldn't believe me. Although that man has been repeatedly charged with sexual assault. He's managed to avoid conviction every time due to lack of evidence. He was a menace to society. He got what he deserved. I can only assume that L has already informed you of this: I can't kill someone who I haven't seen. I have to know their face, which means of course, I could easily kill all these people right now if I wanted to. Go ahead and choose someone if you want."
Raye,D-don't do it. I believe you. You're Kira.
Light,I'm sure you care more about your loved ones than any of these people here. Imagine how you'd feel if one of them was killed just because you refused to cooperate. I think you should consider them the real hostages at the moment.
,Raye flinches and then glances back
Raye,How do you know about her?
Light,"[chuckles] You seem surprised. I've been investigating you, and if you don't do exactly as I say, she will die and so will the rest of your family, including you. And that's a promise."
Raye,I-I understand. Just tell me what you need me to do.
Light,I see you've got your laptop with you. I want the files containing the identities of all the FBI agents who came to Japan.
Raye,"I do have my laptop with me. It's the one I use for work, but I don't have the files you're looking for."
,Light holds a manila envelope out to Raye
Light,"Alright, then take this envelope."
Raye,Huh? [takes envelope]
Light,"First, take the transceiver out of the envelope, then put the earpiece in, and await my instructions"
,"Towards the end of his sentence Light backs away into the shadows. Once he's gone, Raye pulls the transceiver out of the envelope."
Raye,[thinking] A transceiver? This thing looks like a toy.
,"Fade to slightly different angle of Raye, at which point he has his hand on the transmitter now in his ear"
Raye,[cont'd][thinking] But there'll be no record of this transmission anyway. And it allows us to converse from a close distance even underground. You really thought this through.
Light,"Alright. Now get on the Yamanote Line, inner or outer route. It doesn't matter which direction you take. I'll be close by at all times, which means I'll be watching your every move. When you get on the train, pick a spot in front of you and don't take your eyes off it. If I see you looking around, I will kill you. Once you've boarded, I want you to take the seat closest to the doors. If it's occupied, wait until it's free."
,A train sounds its horn as it passes
,"Dissolve to some point later on. A train screeches as it comes to a stop. Closeup of Raye, then a sign, then Raye sitting on the train."
Light,"Now, I'm going to ask you something. If I have even the SLIGHTEST suspicion that you're not being honest, your girlfriend is as good as dead. How many FBI agents are currently in Japan? Speak quietly into the transceiver, and don't make it obvious."
Raye,[lifts collar of jacket] I believe it's four teams. Three agents per team for a total of twelve.
Light,Okay. Now take the papers out of the envelope.
,Raye opens the manila envelope to find a stack of papers that are covered so that blank sections of paper underneath it are visible.
Raye,Huh? [thinking] What... is this?
Light,"Of those twelve agents you mentioned, I want you to write down the name of your superior, the one who's heading up this investigation, on the space on the very top of the page."
Raye,[thinking] What is the meaning of this? What is he after?
,"As he starts writing, we see Light is looking in from the door of the other car"
Raye,"[cont'd][ thinking] Let's face it, he hasn't really left me any choice. Besides, it's not like he can kill them using just their names."
Light,"Next, take out your laptop and turn it on. Any minute now your boss is going to send you a message with a file attachment. It contains the names and photos of all the FBI agents currently active in Japan."
,"Raye is looking at his laptop, the screen filled with the data Light mentioned"
Raye,[thinking] But this... this is...
Light,"Now, one by one you're going to look at each photo and then write that agent's name in the space provided. You're going to do this for each agent."
,Skip forward to Raye writing down the last of the names
Raye,"[thinking] It doesn't make sense. If he's got the names already, why use me? What's he planning to do with them? [closes laptop]"
Light,"Good. Looks like you're done. [cut to Light] Now put the transceiver and all the papers back into the original envelope and place them on the wrack directly above your head. [cut to Raye putting papers in envelope] After that, you’re going to stay in your seat and ride the train for at least another thirty minutes. When you are absolutely certain that nobody will notice you leaving without the envelope, you can get off the train."
,Fade forward to a closeup of the folder on the wrack and then out to Raye still seated on the train
Raye,[thinking] I know that voice. Why on earth can't I remember who it belongs to?
,"Cut to outside the train. White text reading ""PM 4:41"" appears. The train comes to a stop and the doors slide open. Raye continues his thoughts as he steps off the train."
Raye,"[thinking] Kira, who are you?"
,"He gasps and his eyes widen as he comes to a stop. The sound of a heartbeat. Raye makes gurgling noises and clutches at his chest. He falls to his knees and continues to gasp. He falls to his side and scrambles to look behind him and into the car as the door closes behind him. He looks in and sees Light, now wearing no hood and holding the manila folder, looking down at him. It takes effort for his words to come out."
Raye,Light... Yagami.
,Cut to closeup of Light
Light,Farewell... Raye Penber.
,"Closeup of Raye’s eye, which then dilates, then of Raye’s face from inside the car as the door closes in front of him"
,"Cut to black as the sound of the door closing echoes. Fade from black to Light in his bedroom, reviewing the papers Raye had filled in, the covered contents now visible."
Light,"[V.O.] Raye Penber wrote all those names on pages taken from the Death Note. Ironic. Without even realizing it, he was actually signing a death warrant for all of his colleagues. As for Penber's boss, he died of a heart attack after sending all of his agents a file. And the other eleven investigators? [chuckles] They all died of heart attacks after receiving the same file."
,"Eyecatch out – ""The human who touches the DEATH NOTE can recognize the image and voice of its original owner, a god of death, even if the human is not the owner of the note."""
,"Eyecatch in – ""The person in possession of the DEATH NOTE is possessed by a god of death, its original owner, until they die."""
                                                         ,"Cut to: skyline. Kuroi Light plays. Cut briefly indoors to L's room, a closeup of his speakers."
Watari,"[through speakers] L, you have a call from the director of the FBI."
,Cut to American office. There is a brief cut to L and back while he speaks.
Director,"It's me. I've got a report in front of me right now stating all of our agents in Japan are dead. All twelve died of heart attacks. I can only assume that Kira is behind this. Look, I'm sorry but it's already decided. We're calling off our investigation."
,Cut to L's room. Beeping.
Watari,I have Chief Yagami on the line.
Soichiro,"[through speakers] L, I just got off the phone with the director of the FBI. According to him, it seems that you arranged for the FBI to come to Japan and investigate everyone here associated with the task force."
L,"Yes, I did."
Soichiro,So how do you explain this? Are we now suspects in our own investigation?
L,I felt that it was necessary to uncover Kira's identity.
,"Part way through Soichiro's sentence, cut to the room he and the members of the task force are in"
Soichiro,"I cannot accept that! I find it unbelievable that you would spy on us, the very people working with you on this case."
Officer 1,"Hear that? Well, I knew all along we couldn't trust that guy."
Officer 2,"More importantly, Kira killed those FBI agents, didn't he?"
Officer 1,"It's obvious he'll kill anyone who gets in his way, whether they're criminals or not. [cut to L's room] So much for his sense of justice. He's a murderer."
,Beeping
Watari,We have another victim. A note was found at the scene.
L,Hmm...
,Briefly fade from L to Light then back
Light,"[V.O. ]""L, do you know, gods of death..."""
,"L opens up his computer and looks at the note. As Light finishes his sentence, L puts the notes together to finish the message Light left for him"
L,Hmm?
Light,"[cont'd][V.O] ""...love apples?"""
L,"[thinking] Damn you, Kira."
,Fade to Raye Penber's apartment. Sniffling. A closeup of his crying fiancée.
Woman,"He's dead. Raye's dead. No, he was... he was murdered by Kira."
,Fade to black.
,"Cut to: outside the Yagami residence at night. As Sayu starts to talk, cut indoors to the four sitting at the dinner table."
Sayu,"Um, so, what's with the family meeting, Dad?"
Soichrio,"I figured you're going to find out sooner or later, so I might as well tell you now. I don't want you to be alarmed. I'm sure you've heard of this Kira investigation. Well, I'm currently in charge of it."
Sayu,"[sits upright] What? Are you serious? That's totally awesome, Dad. You're the best cop ever!"
Soichiro,That's not quite the point I'm trying to make.
Sayu,Oh?
Soichiro,"You see, the truth is, the FBI sent twelve of their agents to Japan to assist us in finding Kira, and all of them died yesterday?"
Light,Does that mean they were all killed by Kira?
Sayu,What?
Soichiro,What I'm saying is there's a chance that Kira will actually try to kill anyone who comes after him. His crimes are ruthless and more frightening than anything we've seen. Many detectives have already quit.
Sayu,"Dad, you should quit, too! I don't want you to die. What if he gets you?"
Sachiko,That's right. Your life is so much more important than some job.
Soichiro,I can't. I could never forgive myself if I walked away from this. I will not sit back and let evil triumph.
Sayu,"But Dad, you..."
Sachiko,"Please, dear..."
Light,"[after a brief pause] I think it's honorable of you, Dad. [standing up from seat] I'm proud to be able to call you my father. [while exiting the room] And if anything should ever happen to you, I'm going to find Kira. [opens door and looks back] And make sure he gets executed."
,Closeup of Soichiro. Sound of footsteps and the door being shut. Fade to black as Light's Theme plays.
,Fade into outside the Central Government Building No. 2
Soichiro,We now know that Kira doesn't just target criminals. He'll kill anyone who opposes him.
,Cut indoors to Soichiro addressing the task force
Soichiro,"[cont'd] It's quite possible that we might all be killed by Kira. Think of your own lives. Your families and all the others you'd be leaving behind. If anyone wants to leave this investigation, now is the time. You won't be demoted if you choose not to stay. You have my word. But if you're not absolutely sure, then we don't need you. You have to be willing to fight against him, even if that means making the ultimate sacrifice. That is all."
,Zooms out down the hallway
Officer 3,So what're ya gonna do?
Officer 4,I'm not sure.
,"Cut to: bus depot. The Woman is talking to Sasaki, the bus driver from the previous episode. He is looking at a photo she gave him of her and Raye."
Sasaki,"Oh yeah, that's him alright. There's no doubt about it. I remember him because he told us to get down. But I don't really remember any of the other passengers."
Woman,"I see. Well, thanks for talking with me anyway. I appreciate it."
,Fade forward to the woman walking down the street
Woman,"It's a bit of a longshot, but if what I'm thinking is right, Kira could have been one of the passengers on the bus that day. And if that is the case, then I know that he's close enough to use this bus route."
,Cut to: Central Government Building No. 2 interior. Soichiro looks up at the five remaining officers.
Soichiro,"Five men, huh? Well, six, including myself. Still, I'm grateful to see that there are as many as five of you willing to risk your lives to face evil."
L,[distorted by voice changer] The fact that you've chosen to stay means you have a strong sense of justice. I trust all of you.
Aizawa,"Hah, uh, hold on a second. L just said that he's decided to trust us now. But honestly, what reason do we have to trust him?"
Ide,"Look, L. All of us have agreed to put our lives at risk to bring Kira to justice, so I hope you understand what this means. We're really sticking our necks out here."
Aizawa,"But you never have to show your face, do you? You just give the orders. I don't see how you expect us to work alongside you under those conditions."
Soichiro,"L, if all of us are going to work together on this investigation, and if you truly meant what you said about trusting the six of us, could you come here so we could all meet in person?"
L,"[after a pause][distorted] The thought had already crossed my mind. After all, I did say that I trusted all of you."
,"Watari turns the laptop to face them. There is text across the screen. They gasp, and more text continues to be typed out. ""Please keep what is about to happen a secret between the eight of us."""
,Cut to: outside Central Government Building No. 2
Ide,"Why is he seeking our help now? There's only six of us. He's solved all these difficult cases by himself in the past, so what makes this one so different? The way L's been conducting things so far, odds are he's gonna send a stand-in or a proxy of some kind to meet us instead of coming himself. It's not like we'd ever know."
Aizawa,"A proxy, huh? Well, it is possible."
Matsuda,"I believe L. I thnk we can trust him. And besides, I don't really see how we can solve this case without his help."
Mogi,I agree.
,"From the beginning, he's been very upfront about the fact that he would need the help of the police on this case. Perhaps we should think of it like, he's been waiting for this to happen all along."
,L's Theme plays
Matsuda,Why would he do something like that?
Soichiro,"There were a number of people on the task force who distrusted L before this investigation began. And once we got started, we had detectives resigning left and right. Following that, classified information was leaked. So I'm not surprised that he didn't trust us."
Matsuda,"In other words, he was waiting for the task force to get narrowed down to only those investigators he could trust. And to do that, he needed to weed out anyone who wasn't totally committed."
Soichiro,Hmm...
Ide,"[growls][walking away] If we're working with that guy, I’m leaving the task force. You don't have to worry. I won't try to follow you. I'm not interested in finding L."
Sasaki,O-okay.
,"Cut to the front wheel of the bus, which is still spinning as it continues down the road."
Ukita,"Well, I think we can trust L, so I'd be willing to cooperate with him on this investigation."
Aizawa,Count me in.
,"Soichiro nods. Fade to the exterior of the Teito Hotel. As L speaks, we see the task force enter the hotel. As L speaks, Matsuda and Soichiro are seen walking into and moving throughout the hotel."
L,"[distorted] I'm staying at a suite in the Teito Hotel at the moment, but I'll be switching hotels every few days from this point on. I want you to think of these hotel rooms as the de facto headquarters of this investigation. If this arrangement is acceptable to all of you, then split into two groups and stagger your arrival so you come thirty minute apart. Please arrange it so you're all here at midnight."
,"Cut to L alone in his hotel room, which is completely visible for the first time"
L,"Kira. I seems we're getting closer to each other in equal steps. [takes deep breath] It's only a matter of time before we collide. So be it. I'm ready to show my face. I'll make my first public appearance as L. If you ever manage to find out about these secret meetings, I'm sure you'd feel compelled to move in. [takes deep breath] That's what I'm counting on."
,"Fade into Light in his room. As he thinks, flasbacks of the previous episode and earlier in this episode."
Light,[thinking] I've been quite active over these past few days. Think carefully. Was there anything I missed? What comes next? There are endless possibilities. The real battle is only just beginning. L...
,Cut to Soichiro and Matsuda outside of L's hotel room. Soichiro raises his fist and knocks on the door twice.
L,"[voice muffled from inside] It's unlocked. Please, let yourself in."
Soichiro,Hmm...
,"He puts his hand on the door handle, and it echoes as he turns it"
,TO BE CONTINUED
,Ending credits
,Next episode preview
Light,This woman. If she had spoken to the police before I met her... But it seems there's a god on my side after all. And not just a god of death.
,Opening Theme
,Title card
,"Cut in: Teito Hotel, L's suit. He stands scratching himself in front of the confused task force. Many gasps, ""hmms"", and ""huhs""."
L,[monotone] I am L.
Soichiro,[thinking]] This is him?
Matsuda,Hmm. He's nothing like he thought I'd be.
,"Aizawa, Mogi, and Ukita all share looks and continue to make small noises of surprise"
Soichiro,"Hmm. [pulls out badge] I'm Yagami, of the NPA."
,The other task force members show their badges as they each introduce themselves
Matsuda,"Uh, Matsuda."
Aizawa,I'm Aizawa.
Mogi,Mogi.
Ukita,Ukita.
Soichiro,"I'm very sorry we're late. Currently, the five of us are—"
,L makes a finger gun and points it at the task force
L,Bang!
Task force,Huh?
Matsuda,Uh?
Aizawa,What the hell was that?
L,"Hmm... If I were Kira, you'd be dead Mr. Soichiro Yagami for the NPA."
,The task force members gasp
L,"Kira needs a face and a name in order to commit murder. But I'm sure you've already figured that much out, haven't you? Please, do not give out your names so carelessly. Instead, let's value our lives."
Matsuda,"I knew that he needed a face to kill someone, but I don't remember any evidence that showed that he needed a name, too."
Soichiro,"There's no way to verify if this is related, but criminals whose names were never released publicly or whose names were spelled incorrectly in the media have not been targeted. We briefly went over it at one of our meetings."
L,That's enough small talk for now. Come this way.
Matsuda,"Oh, uh, right."
L,"Please turn off all your cell phones, handhelds, and any other communication devices, and leave them on the table right there."
Aizawa,"What, do you think we're going to be using our cellphones during this meeting to leak information?"
Soichiro,It's alright. Just do as he says.
Matsuda,"[as they all place their cellphones on the table] I realize he's been cautious from the very beginning, but I still can't tell if he trusts us or not."
,The task force enter the room L has gone to as he speaks. Matsuda gasps. 
L,"[taking a seat] No, I just find them distracting. I can't stand it when people's cellphones are ringing while I'm trying to talk. Let me start by saying nobody takes notes on anything that's said in these meetings. That means when we leave headquarters, any information we need is committed to memory. Please, make yourselves comfortable."
Soichiro,Huh. Right.
,"L looks over the task force members as they all take a seat. Fade forward. L pours himself a cup of tea and takes a sip. He swallows, a dissatisfied look on his face and ""hmms"", then begins scooping a bunch of sugar cubes into his drink."
Matsuda,"Excuse me, L?"
Woman,"Mmm, and from now on I'll have to ask that you stop calling me ""L"". It's ""Ryuzaki"" now, just to be safe."
Matsuda,"Uh, okay, Ryuzaki. If we know that he needs a name and a face to kill, couldn't we cut down on the number of victims by keeping criminals names from the news?"
Ryuzaki,"If we do that, we'll only be putting the general public at risk."
Ukita,The general public?
Aizawa,Why?
,L stops stirring his tea and looks up at them
Ryuzaki,"Kira is childish, and he hates losing."
Matsuda,But how do you...
Soichiro,Just what do you mean?
Ryuzaki,"Well, I'm also childish and I hate to lose. That's how I know. [sips tea]"
Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, would you mind being a little more specific for us."
Ryuzaki,"Mnn, early on in the investigation, I tried to provoke Kira with that broadcast."
,Fade back to the broadcast with Lind L. Tailor as L talks
Ryuzaki,"[V.O.] Up until then, Kira would only go after criminals. But as we all witnessed, he didn't hesitate to kill my stand-in."
,Flashbacks of prisoners dying
Ryuzaki,"[V.O.] Also, as soon as I said we knew he was in the Kanto region, in defiance, he made sure his next victims came from within Japan, as if to say, ""'n' what're you gonna do about it?"""
,Fade from black back to present. L takes a sip of his tea.
Ryuzaki,"Mmm. He's met each of my challenges head-on, and he's never missed an opportunity to return the favor. Now what do you think would happen if we tried to use media restrictions to hide criminals from someone like that?"
Matsuda,I guess...
Ryuzaki,"Hmm. ""If you choose to withhold the names of your worst criminals, I'll kill petty criminals or the innocent. I'm holding the whole world hostage, so who's it gonna be? I'm not the evil one here, but all those who oppose me by hiding criminals? You are truly evil."" [sighs] That's exactly how Kira thinks. In any case, let's look at another way we can use the media to draw him out."
Aizawa,But how?
Ryuzaki,"How about something like this? ""Death of FBI agents infuriates the U.S. Latest killings anger the international policing community. Nations agree to send fifteen hundred investigators to Japan."""
Aizawa,Ah...
Ryuzaki,"For Kira, this will be way beyond what he faced with the FBI. He'll see everyone as a potential threat. Psychologically, he'll start to feel cornered, and that will cause him to take some kind of drastic action."
,The task force make noises of realization and understanding
Ukita,That's interesting.
Aizawa,"So he'll think there are fifteen hundred, when there are really only seven of us. And since none of these investigators exist, Kira won't be able to kill them."
Ukita,It just might work.
Ryuzaki,"Well, before we celebrate, I'll tell you the rest of my thoughts on the Kira case."
,The task force make grunts of agreement and nod
Ryuzaki,Kira works alone. He had access to all our classified information.
Aizawa,What evidence do you have that he's working alone?
Soichiro,"Hold on, Aizawa. Let's listen to his entire theory before asking questions."
Ryuzaki,"We know he needs a name and a face to kill. And to some extent he can control a victim's time of death and their actions before dying. We already know that much. Please keep that in mind [uncaps marker] and listen carefully to what I have to say next. [begins to write] On December fourteenth, twelve FBI investigators enter Japan. Here we are on December nineteenth. Using prison inmates, Kira conducts experiments manipulating his victims' actions before they die. In other words, during this window of only five days, Kira became aware of the FBI's presence and obviously felt threatened. Because he didn't know any of their names or faces, he was at a disadvantage. He needed to know how much control he had over his victims before he could use it against the twelve agents. And as we all know, on December twenty-seventh."
,Fade to: Light Yagami in his bedroom
Light,"[thinking] I got a hold of a file which contained all the names and faces of the FBI investigators in Japan, and I succeeded in killing each one of them. It's practically impossible to guess which agent gave the file to Kira, but [brief flashback of interaction with Raye Penber] I have to make sure no one ever finds out that I came into contact with Raye Penber. [writes 12/10 BUS in notebook]"
,"Ryuk walks over, apple in hand"
Ryuk,Huh? How come you're not using the Death Note today? You studying for those entrance exams? [eats apple]
Light,"Those are the least of my worries. Plus, it's a little late to start now."
Ryuk,Oh? Whatcha doing?
,Light has mapped out timeline of events in his notebook
Light,December nineteenth to December twenty-seventh. I've been most active during this period.
,Cut back to: Ryuzaki. He has created a similar timeline on the table
Ryuzaki,"During this period, to the best of our knowledge, at least twenty-three individuals died of heart attacks. But these victims were different from Kira's previous targets. They were all alleged criminals, ex-convicts, or suspects in on-going investigations, so legally speaking, they were innocent."
Soichiro,That's true.
,A slow version of L's theme begins to play
Ryuzaki,"What this indicates, is that Kira had to manipulate these lesser criminals in order to kill those FBI agents. He killed that many people so we'd be unable to kill the decoys from those who were actually used. In truth, he probably only needed a few. He waited eight days so the FBI could investigate other suspects, which meant there'd be no timeline linking him to their deaths. I suspect Kira had to be one of the people being investigated by the FBI between the fourteenth and the nineteenth of December. In fact, I have no doubt. [scribbles out the line he drew between the fourteenth and nineteenth]"
,"The task force gasp in realization. Ryuzaki picks up a pile of documents, then places it on the table."
Ryuzaki,"These are files provided by the FBI, and they contain additional information you might find useful. For obvious reasons, you're not permitted to take these out of this room, but— [he gasps as he's interrupted]"
Matsuda,"Amazing! There might only be five of us, but with this much information, we should be able to cover a lot of ground."
Aizawa,"We'll split into two teams. One team traces the FBI agents, the other looks at the heart attack victims"
Matsuda,"There weren't that many people who had access to information from headquarters, and of those the FBI only investigated a small group in the first five days"
Aizawa,Yeah. Yeah!
Ryuzaki,So. Does anyone have any questions?
Task force,Huh?
Soichiro,"Actually, Ryuzaki, I do have one question for you. And it pertains to what you said to us earlier about how you hate to lose. Does that fact that you've shown us your face mean that you've lost? By just being here, are you admitting defeat to Kira?"
Ryuzaki,"That's right. By showing my face to you know and by sacrificing the lives of twelve FBI agents, I have lost the battle. But I'm not gonna lose the war. This is the first time I've ever put my life on the line. I want to show Kira that we're all willing to risk our lives, if that what it takes, [chuckles and smiles] and that justice will prevail no matter what."
Mogi,"Hey, yeah, that's right!"
Matsuda,I like the sound of that.
Ukita,We can do this!
Aizawa,"Alright, then. Let's do this, Ryuzaki!"
Soichiro,"[thinking] Well, I had my doubts about whether it was really him at first, but there's no mistaking it. This man is L."
Ryuzaki,"Before we go any further, I have to be absolutely sure that none of you are Kira, so I'll need to speak with each of you individually before you leave today."
,"Aizawa scoffs, Soichiro ""hmms"""
Aizawa,What's the deal? He still doesn't trust us?
Soichiro,"No, I think it's a fair request. Try and see it from his perspective. Kira's been getting information from our headquarters from the very beginning, so there's a good chance he's one of us."
Matsuda,He's right. Working on this case has given us a chance to see him in person.
Aizawa,[in realization] He's risking his life to be here.
Ryuzaki,[staring out window][thinking] Things are going well. Just one clue—a single decisive factor's all I need.
,"Cut to Light still writing in his notebook. He circles ""bus""."
Light,[thinking] Just one oversight. A single piece of evidence is all it would take. It could cost me my life.
,Split-screen of Ryuzaki and Light
Ryuzaki and Light,Just one thing.
,"Transition to the Woman—Raye Penber's fiancée—alone at night on a bridge, staring into the distance"
,"Eyecatch out — ""If the human uses the note, a god of death usually appears in front of him/her within 39 days after he/she uses the note."""
,"Eyecatch in — ""Gods of death, the original owners of the DEATH NOTE, do not do, in principle, anything which will help or prevent the deaths in the note."""
,Cut to: Yagami household. Cut inside to Light lying on his bed.
Ryuk,You already finished studying?
Light,"I guess. [thinking] I'll be fine. I haven't missed anything. The biggest risk I've taken so far was that busjacking incident. But they'll never be able to connect it with Kira. Fortunately for me, both the police and L don't know that Kira can kill people by means other than a heart attack. However, if anyone were to discover that, I'd be in a lot of trouble."
,Cut to living room. Sayu Yagami is on the couch.
Sayu,Whaaaaaat? Does it have to be now?
Sachiko,"[holding out bag of clothes] Your father's been pulling overnighters with now change of clothes, so you're going to bring these to him."
Light,"But Mooooom, I totally promised my friends that I'd go out with them today."
Light,[having walked into the living room] Why don't I go? I could use a break.
Sayu,"Thanks, Light. I owe you one next time! [eats chips and chuckles]"
,Cut to Light's room
Ryuk,So I guess this will give you a chance to spy on the police.
Light,"I won't go further than the reception desk. [he opens his trap drawer and retrieves the Death Note, then rips out a page and folds it]"
Ryuk,"Ooooh, you're bringing a page. Planning to kill someone?"
Light,"No, but lately I've been bringing a page with me every time I go out, just in case."
,Cut to: the Woman standing in a subway car
Woman,"[thinking] That day. Raye said that he was planning to go to Shinjuku. That same day, four people died of heart attacks in the Shinjuku area, and there was the bus jacking."
,"Shot of her holding a news clipping with an image of Kiichiro Osoreda and the caption ""BUS-JACKER DIES AFTER BEING HIT BY CAR"". Transition, she exits the subway station."
Woman,[thinking] There's no way it was a coincidence.
,Fade in from white. The Woman standing outside of NPA building.
Woman,[thinking] That's it! Kira can kill in other ways. It doesn't have to be a heart attack.
,Fade in from white: Light walking down the street on his cell phone
Voice mail,The mobile customer you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. For voicemail—
Light,That's unusual for Dad. [hangs up] I wonder if he's in a meeting right now.
,"Light enters the NPA building with Ryuk hovering behind him. The Woman is at the front desk, trying to get help."
Woman,"Please, I need to speak directly with someone from the special investigation task force. It's urgent."
Receptionist 1,"I'm sorry ma'am, but I can't help you. As I've told you already, there is no one at task force headquarters right now."
Woman,[sighs]
Light,[thinking] There's no one at headquarters? Dad's cell is turned off. What's going on?
Woman,Can't you contact them somehow? I have information relating to the Kira investigation.
Light,[thinking] The Kira investigation? [approaches]
Receptionist 1,"Look, I'll call headquarters one more time for you. [picks up phone] One moment."
Light,"[approaching desk with bag] Hi, I'm Detective Soichiro Yagami's son, Light Yagami. I brought my father a change of clothes, but it doesn't look like he's in. Can I leave them here?"
Receptionist 2,"Sure. Hey, I haven't seen you in a while, Light."
Light,"Oh, I'm sorry, uh..."
Receptionist 2,"What, you don't remember? You helped solve the insurance fraud murder investigation. Sometime last year. But hey, no one remembers the receptionist, do they?"
Light,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm terrible with faces. I just need to sign my name on this form, right?"
Receptionist 2,"So Light, does this mean you're gonna be helping us with the Kira investigation, too?"
Light,"Sure! If all goes well, maybe I'll find Kira before L does."
Woman,[looks up at Light][thinking] Find him before L does?
Receptionist 2,"[hangs up phone] As I thought, there's no one at headquarters. You're going to have to trust me on this, ma'am. I'll be sure to give them your message as soon as I see them. I promise."
Woman,That's not good enough. I have to tell them in person!
Light,Excuse me?
,"They all look over at Light. Receptionist 1 ""huhs""."
Light,"My father is actually in charge of the Kira investigation. If you'd like, I could pass your message onto him. His cellphone is off at the moment, but I should be able to contact him soon. A number of FBI agents were just killed, and a lot of detectives have quit the case because they're afraid of Kira, so he's pretty busy right now"
Receptionist 2,"Uh, Light, it's probably better if you don't discuss this with."
Light,"True, but it's practically common knowledge at this point. Besides, I feel like I can trust her. You can almost see it in her eyes. She's a wise and careful person. You heard about what happened, and you must have figured out that the police had a leak of some kind. And that's why you wanted to tell them in person. You thought this through. Well, am I right?"
Woman,[gasps]
,"Cut forward to Light and the Woman walking down the street together, Ryuk hovering behind them"
Light,"I'm sure my father will call me once he checks his messages. When he does, I'll give you the phone and let you talk to him."
Woman,[they stop] You're sure that's alright?
Light,"Oh yeah. You understand why I can't just give you my father's cell phone number, but I have no problem letting you use my phone to talk to him. You'll have to trust my father and I, which I hope won't be too difficult for you. [laughs]"
Ryuk,[thinking] Why is he so happy?
Woman,[bows] Thank you so much.
Ryuk,"[laughs] She walked right into that one, didn't she?"
,Fade forward
Light,"I've gotta say, you must be pretty brave to be getting involved in the Kira case like this."
Woman,"Oh, not really."
Light,"So according to you, is Kira some [clears throat]. Um, we've been talking, and I just realized I don't even know your name. My name is Light Yagami. ""Light""'s written with the character for ""moon"" and ""Yagami"" for the characters ""night"" and ""god"". [chuckles] Kinda weird, huh?"
Shoko,"My name's Shoko Maki. It's written with the characters for ""shining"". ""Ko"" as in ""child"" space and ""ki"" as in ""tree""."
Light,"Miss Maki, right?"
,Ryuk laughs
Light,"Miss Maki, I've been thinking about Kira's powers, and I believe they somehow enable him to control his victims before they die."
Shoko,"So do I! It's odd that you say that, because that's exactly what I've been thinking. Kira's able to control their actions before he kills them, but there's more to it. If my analysis so far is correct, Kira can kill in a number of ways, not just with a heart attack."
Light,[thinking] She knows? Who is this woman?
Shoko,"I don't think anyone else knows this yet. But if the police are willing to consider it, I bet it could help them catch Kira."
Light,"You know, that possibility never even crossed my mind. So what you're saying is, any time Kira wants one of his murders to go undetected, he wouldn't use a heart attack."
Shoko,Right. I'm almost positive someone I know may have met Kira.
Light,"Met Kira? [laughs] I'm sorry, but if a person came in saying they met Kira, the police would be more than a little skeptical, to say the least."
Shoko,"[dejectedly] I know. That's why I need to explain it in person to someone at task force headquarters. Otherwise, I'm afraid they'd just write me off"
Light,But wouldn't it be better if your friend spoke to them instead?
Shoko,"He probably would, but he's no longer alive. He was one of the twelve FBI agents who came to Japan to investigate Kira."
Light,[gasps][thinking] An FBI agent. Who met Kira. Could it be?
Shoko,"[echoing] You see, he was also my fiancé. While he was working, he got caught up in a bus-jacking, and I have reason to believe that he met Kira on that bus."
Light,[thinking] Raye Penber. [stops walking]
Shoko,[stops and turns around] Is something wrong?
Light,Nothing. I'm sorry to hear that he passed away. [they continue walking] So what makes you think he met Kira on that bus.
Shoko,"Because eight days after that bus was hijacked, he died, along with the other FBI investigators. The same man had attempted to rob a bank two days before he hijacked that bus, then he dies in an accident? Just like that? [chuckles] I mean, really, what are the odds? I've come to believe that Kira set up that bus-jacking. It was planned to bring him in contact with my fiancé, in order to obtain information on the identities of the other FBI agents, so he could get rid of them all. Anyway, what stands out to me is that the hijacker died in an accident. In other words, it suggests that heart attacks aren't the only way Kira can kill people. [stops at light]"
Light,"Okay, so the busjacker didn't die of a heart attack, and based on that, you're saying Kira has other ways of killing people?"
Shoko,Yes.
Light,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that's a bit of a leap of faith."
Shoko,"There's no other way of looking at it. If Kira was controlling the hijacker, chances are, he killed him, too."
Light,I still don't see it.
Shoko,"I've been wondering about that bus-jacking ever since my fiancé first told me about it. After he calmed down, I asked him for details. He didn't mention any names or anything like that, but he told me one thing."
Light,What did he say?
Shoko,That he'd been put in a situation where he had to show his FBI ID to someone.
Light,Hmm...
Shoko,The operation was undertaken secretly without the NPA's knowledge. He wasn't allowed to show his ID. I think whoever saw his ID that day is responsible for the deaths of all the agents.
Ryuk,[thinking] Unbelievable. She figured it out! This must be the oversight Light was worried about.
Light,"I understand. You're the only one who knows any of this, and you want nothing more than to avenge your fiancé by bringing Kria to justice, right? And now you're convinced that Kira can kill without using a heart attack?"
Shoko,Yes.
Light,"There's no doubt in my mind your deductive skills are excellent, but you can't deny that you have a personal interest in the case. Still, your theory is worth looking into. That's for sure. Your testimony could be central to the case."
Shoko,It could.
Light,"If what you're telling me is true, then it'll only be a matter of time before the police catch up with Kira. The person your fiancé showed his ID to on the bus that day, it had to be Kira."
Shoko,[nods] That's right.
,Everything plays in slow motion as they cross the street
Light,That was close. This woman. If she'd spoken to the police before I met her... But it seems there's a god on my side after all. And not just a god of death.

Light,"I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies, but I can't be caught following her around. Go on. Hurry to your death."

,Opening Theme
,Title card
,"Cut to: brief shot of two buildings, then Light Yagami and Shoko Maki walking down the street together"
Light,"[thinking] Regardless of how she came to the conclusion, the fact remains this woman knows the truth. If she gives this information to the police, it won't take them long to figure out that Kira is actually me. I have no choice but to eliminate her."
Shoko,Something wrong?
Light,"[stops] Oh, it's nothing. But the more I think about it, the more your theory makes sense to me. We can't waste any time. We need to start investigating it right away."
Shoko,What? Really? Do you mean that?
Light,Yes. So have you told anyone else about this?
Shoko,No. You're the first person I've told.
Ryuk,"[chuckles] You're lucky, but how can you get rid of her? It's not like you can do it here."
Light,"[thinking] Well, you have a gift for stating the obvious, Ryuk. [reaches into pocket and pulls out paper from the Death Note and a pencil]"
Ryuk,"Oh, aren't you bold."
Light,Let's get started. Could you please tell me the date and time of the bus-jacking incident?
Shoko,"It was December twentieth, in front of Asagao Hill, at 11:02 A.M., bound for Space Land."
Light,"[writing] December twentieth, and they were on their way to Space Land."
Shoko,Yes.
,"Shot of the paper. Light has written ""Thinks of the best way to commit suicide that won't bother others and will make it so her body isn't discovered. Thinks of nothing but suicide, carries out her plan, and dies within 48 hours."" Ryuk laughs."
Light,"[thinking] This way, no one will find her body. And even if they do, they'll just assume that the death of her fiancé drove her to commit suicide."
Ryuk,[laughs]
Light,"[thinking] Hmm? What's so funny, Ryuk?"
,Ryuk continues to laugh maniacally
,Cut to: exterior of Teito Hotel
Ryuzaki,"I apologize for questioning you all like that, but I am afraid I had no other choice."
,Cut inside to Ryuzaki and task force sitting around a table
Ryuzaki,[cont'd] I've determined that Kira is not among us.
,The task force members all sigh in relief
Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, how can you be certain that we're all innocent?"
Ryuzaki,"Well, to be honest, from the beginning I set a number of traps that would reveal if any of you was Kira. But after speaking with you one-on-one, I don't feel the need."
,"""Huhs"" and sighs of relief from the task force Ryuzaki's cellphone rings"
Ryuzaki,Excuse me. [picks up phone]
Matsuda,[thinking] Unbelievable. He tells us to turn off our cellphones.
Ryuzaki,[on phone] Understood. I'm just about finished here anyway. You got the key so let yourself in. [hangs up] Watari is on his way.
,The task force members gasp
,Cut to: Light and Shoko 
Light,"[putting paper and pencil in his pocket] So that's everything. I'd like to report this incident to my father, if it's okay with you, that is."
Shoko,"Well, if it's all the same, I think I'd like to report it myself. And after talking to you, I've decided that it would be best to do it as soon as possible. [turns and starts walking]"
Light,"[following] Uh, that makes sense. [thinking] Just ten seconds until 1:15. I have to admit, I'd really love to see how she dies, but I can't be caught following her around. [closeup of his watch ticking in the background] Go on. Hurry to your death."
,"The clock strikes its final number, but nothing happens. They continue to walk as it ticks in the background"
Shoko,Kira will definitely be caught. Don't you think?
Light,"[eyes widening] Huh? ...Hmm [checks watch; ticking stops][thinking] What's going on? It should have happened already. This doesn't make sense. I don't understand why she's not leaving. I've had no problems making people kill themselves in the past. All I had to do is write the word ""suicide"". The criminals I tested it on all hung themselves exactly when I specified. My experiments indicate that in a situation like this, I should be able to control a person's actions. So what's wrong?"
Ryuk,[laughs maniacally]
Light,"[thinking] Ryuk... He laughed just like that when I was writing in the Death Note. And that's not all. I remember thinking how it was bizarre how he laughed when I asked for her name. In fact, he's reacted the same way every time her name comes up. An alias!"
,Transition to: Teito Hotel. Watari stands in front of the task force. They gasp. He takes off his hat.
Watari,"Gentlemen, it's an honor to meet all of you."
,Quiet gasps from the task force]
Aizawa,This person is Watari?
Matsuda,"Um, what about your usual outfit?"
Watari,"If I dressed like that, I'd be announcing to the world that I am ""Watari"". That's all it takes to give away the location of our headquarters and Ryuzaki."
Matsuda,Oh. I see.
Watari,"Ordinarily, I would never show my face to any of you. The fact that I'm here is proof that you've won Ryuzaki's trust."
Matsuda,"[rubbing the back of his head] Now that you mention it, I do feel honored. [laughs nervously]"
Watari,"[holding forth a silver briefcase] Well then, I've brought those items you requested. It's all here."
Ryuzaki,Could you please pass them out to everyone?
Watari,"Yes. [opens briefcase to reveal new police IDs] Gentlemen, these are your new police IDs."
,"Task force ""uhs"" and ""huhs"" in confusion"
Aizawa,But what for?
,"Cut back to: Light and ""Shoko Maki"" walking down the street"
Light,"[thinking] She used an alias. That has to be it! Ryuk knew all along. He could see her real name with his eyes. That's why he wouldn't stop laughing. I should've known. She's been overly cautious from the beginning. I see. It makes a lot of sense. She believes that Raye died because he showed his ID to Kira. So of course she'd be careful not to reveal her own identity. Oh, this isn't good. It's gonna be almost impossible to ask for her real name knowing she gave me an alias the first time. If I'm too persistent, she'll get suspicious. What am I saying? It looks suspicious that I even knew she was using an alias."
Shoko,[stops and turns to look at Light] I should probably be getting back soon.
Light,Hmm?
Shoko,Someone from the task force might be back there by now.
Light,"Oh, yeah, you could be right. Let's cross our fingers and hope someone's there."
Shoko,"Yeah. [""walks off""]"
Light,"[""thinking""] Dammit! I'm running out of options here. [""quietly growls and starts to follow Maki again""] I have to stop this before it's too late. Oh no. What if my father calls back now? I already promised her that I'd let her talk to him if he did. If this phone rings, it's all over for me. What am I gonna ""do""? [""pause""] This is crazy. All I have to do is turn my cellphone off. [""phone beeps off""] Problem solved. Now, calm down. You know what needs to be done. Just find out her real name. Her purse. Her pockets. She's gotta have a driver's license or some kind of personal identification on her somewhere. She's a woman after all. I suppose if I ""had"" to, I could use force. No... no, the last thing I want to do is make a scene in public. I've gotta get her somewhere isolated. But where? And what explanation could I give her? Ah, it would never work, she's too careful. I need a better approach. I can do this. I'm going to convince her to give me her real name."
,"""Ryuk laughs. He hovers behind Light and his eyes glow red."""
Ryuk,"Hey, Light. You know, that deal I mentioned is still open. It's just like putting on contact lenses. Completely painless."
Light,"[""thinking""] Would I be giving to give up half my life, just so I could learn this woman's real name? ...No. I ""wouldn't"". In fact, it's not even worth considering. Now quit wasting my time! Just shut your mouth, Shinigami."
Shoko,"[""stops and turns""] Excuse me."
Light,"[""stops""] Yes?"
Shoko,"Uh, do you still have business at the police station, then? I'd like to go there by myself, if you don't mind."
Light,"[""pauses""] Yeah, no problem."
,"Fade in from black to: task force in L's suite staring at their new badges. Brief closeup of Soichiro's, with the fake name ""Asashi Siyuurou"" written on it."""
Soichiro,Our names and ranks are false.
Matsuda,Why did you give us fake IDs?
Ryuzaki,"As you know, Kira requires a name and a face to kill. [""sips tea""] We will confront him with that premise in mind. And I think it should be obvious why."
Ukita,"Yes, but of all people, the police shouldn't use fake IDs."
Soichiro,"Enough. What choice do we really have, given the capabilities of our enemy? As long as you're working on this case, I think we're going to need all the protection one can get. It would be foolish not to use them."
Matsuda,"Yeah, you've got a good point."
Aizawa,[nods] Uh-huh.
Ryuzaki,"Remember, anytime you're in a situation where you have to give out your name to a stranger, make sure to use the name from your fake ID. Undestood?"
,Nods and grunts of confirmation
Matsuda,Right.
Ryuzaki,And be careful not to take them out while in the presence of other police officers. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that could cause problems for us.
,Nods and grunts of confirmation
Aizawa,I understand.
Watari,"[opening another silver briefcase on a table filled with belts] Very well, then. I'd like to request that you wear these at all times."
Matsuda,"Uh, belts?"
Watari,Each one has a transmitter in the buckle. This will allow Ryuzaki to monitor your whereabouts. And when you press the buckle twice like this...
,"He presses the buckle of the belt in his hand, and his cellphone begins to ring. He fishes for it in his pocket."
Watari,"[cont'd] ...my cell phone will ring, displaying your name. [hangs up cell phone] And I'll call you back immediately, but you won't see my number displayed. In the morning, all of you will go to the police station as usual. Then, later on in the day, we'll use this method, we'll use this method to confirm the name of Ryuzaki's hotel and his room number. Please use this for emergencies as well"
Matsuda,"[smiling and fiddling with his belt] No way, this is totally cool! I feel like some kind of secret agent going after Kira!"
Soichiro,"Quiet, Matsuda! This is not the time to be fooling around. Knock it off!"
Matsuda,"[dejectedly] Yes, sir."
,Cut to: Shoko and Light
Shoko,"Thank you so much for everything you've done, Light. After talking to you, I feel much more confident about my theory."
Light,Not at all
,Shoko nods and begins to walk away
Light,"[thinking] Considering that Ryuk mentioned that eye deal again, there's no doubt in my mind that she used an alias. At this rate, once she goes to the police with her theory about Kira being on that bus, and they look at all the people Raye Penber was investigating, it won't take them long to zero in on me."
Ryuk,"[chuckles] Hey, she's leaving. So now what?"
Light,"[thinking] I've got about five minutes before that woman gets to police headquarters. Think. I need her real name, and I don't have much time to spare."
,"Eyecatch out — ""A god of death has no obligation to completely explain how to use the note or rules which apply to the human who owns it."""
,"Eyecatch in — A god of death can extend his life by putting human names on the note, but humans cannot."""
,"Fade in from black: Light following ""Shoko Maki"""
Light,"[thinking] If this woman makes it to the police station and someone from the task force has returned by then, it'll all be over for me. I've gotta find out a real name and eliminate her quickly. Only three minutes left until she reaches the station. Alright. [walks faster to catch up]"
Ryuk,Oh? Whatcha doin'?
Light,Excuse me.
Shoko,Yes?
,"""Kuroi Light"" begins to play"
Light,There's something that I should probably tell you.
Shoko,Okay.
Light,"The thing is, it'll be impossible for you to contact anyone from the task force directly."
Shoko,Huh?
Light,"[thinking] That's right. Keep the conversation going. I just need to find something she can latch onto, and I've got her. Once she's comfortable, then I can get her real name. I can do this."
Shoko,[annoyed] I can't contact anyone? But why not?
Light,Didn't you find it odd there was no one at task force headquarters?
Shoko,"Uh, yeah, I did find it a bit strange, but I didn't..."
Light,Let me explain: the task force has been organized so that its members can't be identified and nobody on the outside knows who's in charge
Shoko,Mmm...
Light,"If the members names were ever made public or the structure of the task force was revealed, we'd likely see another tragedy along the lines of the one that claimed your fiance's life."
Shoko,I see.
Light,"That's why you were told earlier that no one was at task force headquarters. What I'm trying to say is, you'll never be able to talk to someone directly from the task force, because the police simply won't allow it."
Ryuk,[chuckles] That's pretty clever. I'm impressed.
Shoko,"If this is supposed to be a secret, then how do you know so much?"
,"""Kuroi Light"" comes to a halt. Silence."
Light,Very well. You leave me no choice. It's because I'm actually a member of the task force.
Ryuk,Huh?
Shoko,"I'm sorry. You're telling me that you're an agent. Yes. L is currently in charge of the task force, and he's leading our investigation."
Shoko,"Yes. To be honest, I already suspected that."
Light,"He was concerned that the task force had become to small. Many detectives had quit, fearing for their lives, and so despite the fact that I'm a high school student, he brought me on board to help out with the investigation. After all, I've helped them solve cases in the past."
Shoko,"So L trusts you, then."
Light,"I can go to task force headquarters whenever it suits me, and I'm allowed to investigate freely as I see fit. You see, these days the task force is made up of a chosen few. An elite group of people handpicked for the job by L. All are highly skill, well respected, and above all, trustworthy."
Shoko,[gasps]
Ryuk,[laughs]
Shoko,"[pauses] Thanks for explaining, but just to be safe, I'd like to visit the task force headquarters again."
Light,Huh?
Shoko,Goodbye. [walks away]
Light,"Uh, please, wait a second! [runs to catch up] It's like I just told you. They won't let you talk to anyone."
Shoko,"I know, but I was hoping I could speak with L directly."
Light,[lets out small breath]
,Cut to: Ryuzaki's suite
Ryuzaki,"Oh, and come to think of it, who's at the police station right now?"
Soichiro,"Actually, no one's there at the moment."
Ryuzaki,That's not good news. We need someone there at all times. Work in shifts if you have to.
Soichiro,"I understand. Aizawa, I'll put you in charge of that for today."
Aizawaw,"[standing up] Yes, sir. I'm on my way. Won't take me long."
,"Cut to: Light and ""Shoko Maki"""
Light,"[urgently] Miss Maki, please, wait a second! It's literally impossible to meet L. This is pointless!"
,Light gets in front of Shoko. The two face each other.
Shoko,You may be right. But I think that there's a chance that he'll meet with me.
Light,Huh?
Shoko,"Although the only contact I've had with him is following orders through a computer, he might remember who I am. You see, I worked under him in a case in the U.S. about two years ago."
Light,A-are you serious? You worked under L?
Shoko,"Yes. I didn't tell you this, but up until three months ago, I worked as an FBI agent."
Light,"[gasps][thinking] This is it. Finally, something I can use. [aloud] Guess I shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I noticed early on that your investigative skills were far beyond those of an amateur."
,"""Kuroi Light"" plays"
Light,"[cont'd] You're very cautious, and you seem to have a gift for getting to the heart of the matter. [starts walking away and stops when behind her] If I could, I'd like to learn from you."
Ryuk,[laughs] One lie after another. You make it look easy.
Shoko,"From the beginning, I knew I had to do things outside the regular channels, because from my perspective, both the police and the members of the task force were suspects. But I'm certain that I can trust L. Maybe it's unrealistic, but I think that if I go to the headquarters and give them my name, there's a chance that they'll let me speak with him directly."
Light,"I see. But if the only person you could trust with this info was L, then why me?"
Shoko,"I suppose I was upset that they wouldn't allow me to see anyone from the task force, and then you came along, claiming to be the son of the lead detective and... No, that's not it. I'll be honest with you. It's because, you remind me of L. There's something about you that's just like him."
Light,Hmm... [turns around to face her] Will you investigate this case with me?
Shoko,Huh?
Light,I want you to come work with us as part of the task force. We could use your help.
,Brief shot of Aizawa outside of the Teito Hotel. Back to Light and Shoko. Light is holding out his hand to her.
Light,"[cont'd] Please, I know this is sudden, but the team needs people like you. I'm serious. You could be doing so much more than gathering information on your own. You have all the experience as an FBI agent, your more talented than most of the detectives currently on the task force, and L obviously trusted you in the past. It wouldn't be that difficult for you to join. All you'd need is some valid identification, a recommendation from a current task force member, and of course, you'd need to get L's permission."
Shoko,You want me to join the task force?
Light,I can't help but think it must be fate that I met you today. I'd like to be the one to recommend you.
,Brief shot of Aizawa walking down the street
Light,"[cont'd][rubbing the back of his head] Oh, I'm sorry about that. I guess I got a little bit too excited."
Shoko,It's okay. [chuckles]
Light,"I mean, even if you acted as a consultant on this investigation, it would be a great help. I'm sure you have personal obligations to attend to. Not to mention the fact that you live in the United States."
Shoko,"It's true. Before all this happened, I thought I'd continue living in America with my fiancé. We'd planned on getting married in the spring. But now he's gone, so I'm not sure what to do anymore."
Light,"[thinking] Alright, I've come this far. All she needs is a little encouragement. [aloud] But you're young and beautiful and you've got your life ahead of you. Why put it all in danger for this"
Shoko,"[desperately] No! Now that Raye's gone, I've got nothing to lose anymore. I want to catch Kira! I don't care about anything else. It's all I wanna do. Please let me investigate this case with you."
Ryuk,Huh? [laughs hysterically]
Light,"Yes, of course. I just need to see some form of identification before we proceed."
Shoko,"Oh, um..."
Light,Yes?
Shoko,"You see, the name I gave you earlier, well, it wasn't actually my real name. [bows] I'm so sorry."
Light,"Don't worry, it's all right. To be honest, I'm impressed by how incredibly thorough you've been. But I suppose that's just further proof of your capabilities."
Shoko,"So will a Japanese driver's license do the trick, then?"
Light,Sure.
,"Shoko pulls a driver's license out of her purse and hands it to Light. Shot of Aizawa, who looks up at the snow beginning to fall and pulls out his umbrella. He approaches Light and Shoko."
Light,[thinking] I made it in time.
,"The license reads ""Naomi Misora"" ""Date of Birth: 2/11/1979"" Light writes ""Naomi Misora Suicide 1/1/2007"" on a piece of paper of the Death Note he's pulled out of his pocket. Aizawa walks by. Light checks his watch."
Naomi,"Uh, so, if you don't mind me asking, why do you keep checking your watch?"
Light,"[Oh, well... I guess it's because... [checks his watch, which has almost hit the forty second mark] Because I'm Kira."
,"Naomi gasps and her eyes widen. She let's out a small noise of fear right before the second hand reaches the 12. They stand facing each other in silence. Naomi's eyes go blank. After a moment, she turns around and walks away."
Light,What's the matter?
Naomi,There's something I have to do.
Light,Hmm. [pulls out cellphone] My father's cellphone might be available now. Do you wanna see if you can talk to him?
Naomi,"No, thank you. I have nothing to say to him."
Light,"Then goodbye, Naomi Misora."
Light,"Okay, so the busjacker didn't die of a heart attack, and based on that, you're saying Kira has other ways of killing people?"
,"Light and Ryuk watch Naomi walk away. The background fades to black with nothing but Naomi and a staircase leading up to a noose. She ascends the stairs, and everything fades to black."

Light,"With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals who names are broadcast on the news, while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams. Just watch me, L."
,Opening Theme
,Title card
,Cut to: Ryuzaki's current hotel suite. TV screens go static as video finishes.
Aizawa,That was footage from surveillance cameras at the station. The death of one of the FBI agents is captured on here. [groans]
Ryuzaki,"Let's see the following scenes again: Raye Penber passing the ticket gate on his way in, then him boarding the train, then finally the part where he dies on the platform. [bites into ice cream]"
Aizawa,Okay. [sorting through surveillance tapes] Let's see...
Matsuda,I think it's next to that.
Aizawa,"Oh, here it is."
Matsuda,"[reviewing document] Um, so based on the records I have here, Raye Penber comes through the west entrance of Shinjuku Station at 3:11 PM. Then at 3:13 he boards a train on the Yamanote Line. But even if he was following someone at that time, I think it's going to be very difficult for us to draw any real conclusions from the blurry video. Then at exactually 4:42 P.M. a—"
,Watari hands him an ice cream cone. Matsuda smiles and takes it.
Matsuda,"[cont'd] Nnn. Oh, thank you, Watari."
,Watari walks towards Soichiro with another as Aizawa eagerly watches. Soichiro quietly thanks Watari as he receives one. Aizawa takes his as Matsuda finishes speaking.
Matsuda,"Uuuumm, and at 4:42 P.M., he exits the train at Tokyo station and dies on the platform"
Ryuzaki,"It's quite strange, don’t you think?"
Aizawa,[happily with ice cream] Hah...
Soichiro,I'm sorry. What do you find strange?
Matsuda,"Yeah, what is it. Did you notice something?"
Ryuzaki,"[licks ice cream] Mmm. [swallows] We know that Raye Penber got on the train and then an hour and a half later he got off and died on the platform. But the Yamanote Line only takes an hour to complete its circuit. And more importantly, there's the envelope."
Aizawa,"Uh, whaddya mean?"
,Ryuzaki rewinds the tape on one of the TVs to Raye and others passing through ticket gates
Ryuzaki,He's holding what looks like an envelope when he passes through the ticket gate.
Aizawa,"[gasps] You're right! It's there, under his arm! [looks at other screen] But in the footage right before his death, it's gone! I can't believe you actually caught that!"
Soichiro,"[grabs paper] Well, I don't see an envelope on this list of his personal effects."
Ryuzaki,"Which means it was left on the train. And if you watch closely, at the very end here... [fastforwards tape to Raye dying on platform] it seems like he's straining to look inside the train before the doors close. You can see right here."
Soichiro,"If that's the case, do you think it could mean something?"
Ryuzaki,Wouldn't it be interesting if Kira was on that train?
Soichiro,That's impossible!
Ryuzaki,"I admit, I find it hard to believe as well. There's no reason for Kira to come to the scene of his own crime when he can kill from a distance. [takes breath] Well... maybe he was counting on us to make that assumption, and figured he could get away with such a bold move. [eats ice cream] Mmm..."
,"Watari looks from Ryuzaki, then to his computer, then eats his own ice cream and returns to his work"
,Cut to: Yagami household exterior
Ryuk,"[offscreen] What's going on with you, Light?"
,"Cut to Ryuk and Light in Light's room. Light is at his desk, writing names in the Death Note."
Ryuk,[cont'd] You haven't stopped writing criminals' names in the Death Note for four days straight. So what are you trying to prove? I don't see the point of writing these names weeks in advance. I've never seen the Death Note used like this.
Light,"Consider it insurance. Suppose the son of the Detective Superintendent of the NPA was hospitalized. If criminals stop dying at the same time, it wouldn't be difficult to connect the two."
Ryuk,So that's what this is.
Light,Are you sure that I can use any date as long as it's before the end of a person's predetermined lifespan?
Ryuk,"Well, I can't guarantee it, because we Shinigami don't normally work that way, but I suppose any time before the end of their lifespan should work."
Light,"I really can't count on you, can I?"
Ryuk,Ya got that right.
,Cut to: Ryuzaki's current hotel suite
Watari,"[on phone] Yes? Yes, would you please hold for a moment? [to Ryuzaki] Ryuzaki, it's Ukita at the NPA. He says he's on the phone with someone from the tip-line who has information for us."
Ryuzaki,"Right. Then give Ukita the number for line five and ask him to have the informant call that line instead. It'll be safer that way. Mr. Matsuda, it's okay for you to turn your cellphone on now. Actually, please turn it on right away."
Matsuda,"Uh, sure."
,"Matsuda turns on his cellphone, which immediately begins to ring. Ryuzaki snatches it from him, turns it on and talks into it with a fake voice."
Ryuzaki,"[using fake voice] Yes, this is Suzuki, head of Kira investigation Public Information Division. [pauses][in real voice] Raye Penber's fiancée? Naomi Misora..."
,Watari nods and begins to look up her information on his laptop
Ryuzaki,[cont'd] I've heard that name before...
,Watari turns his screen to show Naomi's image and information
Ryuzaki,"[gasps] [thinking] So it's her. She's from the Los Angeles BB Murder Case. That's right! She was working under me. I guess she must have come to Japan with her fiancé. [hangs up cellphone and hands it to Matsuda][aloud] Well, apparently she's been missing since the day after her fiancé died."
Matsuda,I'm sure that anyone in her situation would be pretty depressed. Was it...?
Aizawa,Suicide.
Ryuzaki,"No. The Naomi Misora I knew was strong. Not to mention she was also an excellent FBI agent. If anything, it's more likely that she'd be trying to catch Kira. It appears she came to Japan with Penber, it's possible that she may have found a lead... [thinking] If that's the case, did Kira manage to get to her first? [aloud] Everyone. At this point, I'd like to focus our investigation on only those people who Raye Penber was tailing. In particular, he was assigned to two police officers and those closest to them."
Soichiro,Very well. Who are these two individuals he was investigating?
Ryuzaki,"Deputy Director Kitamura, along with Detective Superintendent Yagami and their families."
Soichiro,[gasps]
Ryuzaki,"At this stage, I'd like to place wiretaps and surveillance cameras in both households."
,Cut to: Light Yagami's bedroom. Light is working on his laptop.
Light,"[thinking] I have to make sure there's no evidence left on this computer, just in case someone goes through it. Now I just have to hide these clippings from the Death Note in here."
,Fade forward to Light finishing up some sort of handicraft holder for Death Note papers
Ryuk,"It seems you're pretty skilled with your hands. I bet you're pretty popular with the girls, aren't you?"
Light,"Skill has nothing to do with it. It's your looks that count. I'm guessing you're not that popular, are you?"
Ryuk,[upset] Huh?
,Cut to: Ryuzaki's suite
Matsuda,Surveillance cameras? Ryuzaki!
Aizawa,"I don't see how you could even consider this. If this got out, we'd have a civil rights scandal on our hands! We'd all lose our jobs."
Ryuzaki,You told me you'd be willing to risk your lives for this investigation. But you wouldn't risk your jobs?
Matsuda,"Uh, uh..."
Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, what are the odds that Kira is in one of those households."
Ryuzaki,"Maybe ten percent. No, it's closer to five percent."
Matsuda,"Seriously? I'm sorry, but it's not worth the risk."
Soichiro,No.
Aizawa and Matsuda,[gasp]
Soichiro,"[cont'd] Of all the people we've investigated so far, not one of them seemed even the least bit suspicious. Even if there's only a one percent chance, we simply can't afford to ignore it."
Matsuda,Chief?
Soichiro,"I don't have to tell you how offended I am to learn my family is under suspicion. Having said that, just go ahead with it."
Aizawa and Matsuda,[gasp]
Soichiro,"[cont'd] And make sure you install them everywhere. I don't wany blind spots in the house, and that includes the bathroom."
Ryuzaki,Thank you very much. That was my intention
Aizawa,"Come on, Chief, you don't have to agree to this!"
Matsuda,"Yes, he's right! Think about your family! You have a wife and daughter at home, don't you?"
Soichiro,"[spins around][angrily] Yes, I'm well aware of that fact! But there is no point of doing this if we can't be thorough! Now I suggest you keep quiet!"
,Aizawa and Matsuda makes small noises of disbelief
Matsuda,I'm sorry.
Soichiro,"No, it's okay. Excuse me."
Ryuzaki,"As a courtesy to the chief and his family, only he and I will conduct surveillance of their home. Watari, how long will it take to prepare the wiretaps and cameras we need?"
Watari,"Well, starting tomorrow, I can set them up at any time, provided we know when both houses will be empty."
,Fade to black on Soichiro
,"Cut to: the following day at dusk, in front of the Yagami household"
Light's friend,"[offscreen] See ya later, Light!"
Light,"Yeah, see ya tomorrow. [he grabs the doorhandle to find it's locked][thinking] What? No one's home yet?"
,"He reaches into his pocket, unlocks the door, and enters the house. We briefly see a screen somewhere watching him."
Light,[taking off shoes] I'm home!
,"As he goes upstairs, we briefly see another screen somewhere watching him. He puts his hand on the doorhandle, surprised when it clicks"
Light,Huh? Hmm...
,Light opens the door and a piece of paper that was wedged into the door falls to the ground. Ryuk starts talking as he shuts the door behind him.
Ryuk,"How's it going? I don't think anyone else is in the house right now. Do you wanna play some videogames? [Light lays down on his bed, ignoring Ryuk] Come on, it's been a while!"
,Silence
Ryuk,You listening?
,Light gets up from his bed bed and goes through his closet. Cut to him sticking another piece of paper in between his door. Cut to Soichiro watching him on a screen. 
Soichiro,I don't believe it. I never knew he went to such great lengths. What could he be hiding in their that he doesn't want anyone else to see?
Ryuzaki,"For a seventeen-year-old kid, I wouldn't say this kind of behavior's particularly abnormal. When I was his age, I did strange things, too. Have you ever talked to your son about the investigation?"
Soichiro,"Of course not. I've never once revealed classified information to my family. Besides, I don't get to see them too often these days, and usually as soon as I get home, all I can do is sleep."
Ryuzaki,I understand
,Cut to: Light walking down the street with Ryuk hovering behind him
Ryuk,Where exactly are we going?
,Silence
Ryuk,"Light, don't ignore me when I'm talking to you or I'll get mad. [Light starts checking his jacket] Huh? [as Light starts to think] Hellooooooo?"
Light,[thinking] Doesn't look like these clothes have been bugged. I think we're safe.
Ryuk,[flailing] Yoo-hoooooooo!
Light,"Listen to me! There's a very strong possibility that there are wiretaps, 'n' maybe surveillance cameras, hidden throughout my house."
Ryuk,"Really? But that piece of paper was still in your door, wasn't it?"
Light,"That's true, but I left the paper in the door in a way that it would be obvious to anyone entering the room. The real test is the handle."
Ryuk,It is?
Light,"[as he explains, a split-screen showing a diagram of what he is describing is shown] When that door is closed, the doorhandle automatically returns to a horizontal position, and it won't go any higher than that. But whenever I close the door, I adjust it slightly. Instead of letting it sit horizontally, I lower it by about five millimeters. When I get home and I try to open the door, if the handle is all the way up, I can be fairly certain that someone was in my room. That method alone doesn't tell me if my door was actually opened. So I put a mechanical pencil led in place as well."
Ryuk,So what do you do with it?
Light,"It goes on the hinge. After I close the door, I take the pencil led and rest it on the hinges in such a way that it will break if the door happens to be opened by anyone. Normally, I take it out myself when I get back home. When I got home from school today, I noticed that the pencil lead was broken."
Ryuk,"Now that you mention it, I do remember that."
Light,"First the door handle, then the lead. I know someone was in there today."
Ryuk,Maybe it was your mother.
Light,My family wouldn't have noticed the piece of paper. What's suspicious is that someone took the time to put it back in the door.
,Cut to Light buying books at a bookstore
Clerk,"Hi, there, can I help you?"
Ryuk,What's this all about? Are you buying a book about wiretaps and surveillance so you can figure this mess out?
,"Cut forward to Light walking down the street, Ryuk hovering behind him"
Light,"By the way, Ryuk, what about your apples?"
Ryuk,"Apples? [gasps] That's right! Surveillance cameras! Once the apple's in my mouth, no one can see it, but while I'm holding it, it looks like it's floating."
Light,"I thought so. You told me that Shinigami can't die, so I guess it won't kill you to stop eating apples for a while."
Ryuk,"[desperately] Agh! Don't you think that's a bit much? Come on! I never told you this, but apples are to me, what cigarettes and alcohol are to humans. Do you see what I'm sayin'? I even get withdrawal symptoms."
Light,Oh yeah? What kind of symptoms.
Ryuk,"My body gets all twisted, I do handstands. [doing a handstand] It's not pretty!"
Light,I don't need to see that.
Ryuk,[sighs] I know.
Light,"Okay, here's the thing. Unfortunately, I already gave L the hint that Shinigami love apples, so I just can't afford to take the risk."
Ryuk,When did you...?
Light,"[stopping in front of his house] If it's so important for you to eat apples, you'll have to find out where all the cameras are hidden. If you're lucky, you might find a blind spot where you can eat them without being seen."
Ryuk,Huh...
Light,"Alright, let's go."
Ryuk,[flying to the top floor] Yeah! A camera search! [thinking] Sounds so interesting.
,"Eyecatch out — ""A person can shorten his or her own lifespawn by using the note."""
,"Eyecatch in — ""The human who becomes the owner of the DEATH NOTE can, in exchange if half of his/her remaining life, get the eyeballs of the god of death which will enable him/her to see a human's name and remaining lifetime when looking through them."""
,"Cut to: Yagami household exterior at night. Cut to Light's room, where Light is looking at a centerfold, Ryuk staring from behind."
Ryuk,"Oh... Oh! Uh! [looking around] I, have to find the cameras"
,Cut to Soichiro and L surveilling Light
Soichiro,I can't believe my son is looking at those magazines.
Ryuzaki,"Hm, it's normal for a seventeen-year-old. But it seems contrived. It's too obvious. The only reason he didn't want anyone in his room was because he had these magazines? That's what he wants us to think."
Soichiro,Hey. That's my son you're talking about. Are you honestly telling me that you suspect him?
Ryuzaki,I do suspect him. That's why I placed wiretaps and surveillance cameras in your house and the deputy director's house.
,Cut back to Light's room. Ryuk phases through the air conditioner.
Ryuk,Huh? I found a camera in the air conditioner!
,"He continues to scour the room for cameras, climbing the ceiling and occasionally grunting as he looks around"
Light,"Hmm. [thinking So they really put cameras in here. They must have bugged the place as well. Even if this is the Kira case, I didn't think the Japanese police would ever go this far. This must be L's idea. Which means they've narrowed down their list of suspects. By now they must have figured out that it was someone who Raye Penber was investigating, or they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. [sitting up and closing magazine][aloud] Hmm... Man, these covers mislead you all the time. [thinking] No. Given the situation, it's safer if I just assume I'm their prime suspect, and the only one being watched. It'll be okay. Luckily, I've prepared for this kind of situation."
,Cut to Soichiro watch Light place magazine back in its hiding spot
Soichiro,"Oh, Light..."
,"Cut to Yagami household downstairs, Sayu Yagami calling up to Light"
Sayu,"Hey, Light, come on! Dinner is ready!"
,Cut to closeup of TV
Hideki Ryuga,I love you. Always
Woman,[drops her umbrella and whimpers]
,Sayu whimpers. Cut out to her watching TV in the living room.
Sayu,"Hideki Ryuga. I swear, he's perfect! How come no one in my class is like that?"
Sachiko,"Sayu, just eat your dinner."
,Transition to Ryuzaki watching the Yagamis over surveillance
Sayu,[over speakers] I'll eat later!
Ryuzaki,"[on phone] Hello, Mr. Aizawa? Are the Kitamuras watching television right now?"
Aizawa,"[over phone] Yes. [cut to Aizawa] He's not home, but the other four are watching while they eat dinner. It's channel four."
,"Cut back to Ryuzaki, who hangs up the phone"
Ryuzaki,"Watari, please contact the broadcasters and tell them to play our message."
Watari,Very well. Understood.
,Cut to closeup of TV
Hideki Ryuga,"That's right, my parents met... [rest is inaudible]"
,"There is a beeping sound, then white text appears on the screen"
Sayu,"[offscreen] Huh? What's this? [cut out] ICPO? They're saying that, ""In response to the Kira murders, Interpol has decided to dispatch a force of fifteen hundred investigators to Japan. The investigators were drawn from the law enforcement agencies of its member nations."" Fifteen hundred investigators? Whoa!"
Light,"[thinking] Chances are they've got cameras in the living room as well. Regardless of whether this news is real or not, it's obvious they're just trying to revoke a reaction from me. L, this is the exact same trick you used last time. [aloud] The ICPO sure is stupid."
Sayu,Huh?
Light,"[scoffs] I mean, there's no point in making this announcement. If they're going to send all these people here to investigate, shouldn't they keep it a secret?"
,Cut to Ryuzaki watching
Light,"[over speakers] Even if the FBI agents who were secretly investigating were killed by Kira, why would this be any different? If you ask me, this is nothing more than a desperate attempt to shock Kira, in the hopes that he'll reveal himself somehow. Quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Kira sees right through this."
,"""Kuroi Light"" plays"
Ryuzaki,"Hmm... [chuckles] Your son's clever, isn't he?"
Soichiro,"Huh. Well, yes."
Light,"[over speakers] Thanks for dinner, Mom."
,Cut back to Yagami household. Light opens a cabinet and pulls out a bag of chips.
Sayu,Huh? You're eating a bag of chips? You just had dinner! Your good looks are gonna go down the drain if you keep that up.
Light,It's a late-night snack for studying.
,"Cut forward to Light entering his room. Ryuk is lying on his bed, silently panting."
Ryuk,"I think that's it, Light. I found every camera they put in the house. I guess Shinigami get tired when they work hard. Now let me explain where they all are. It's a little bit complicated, so listen up. There's nothing I hate more than explaining something twice."
Light,"Alright, it's time for me to hit the books."
,Diagram of Light's room and the cameras is shown as Ryuk talks
Ryuk,There sure are a lot of cameras in this room. I counted sixty-four in total. I guess whoever put them in here expected you to find at least some of them.
Light,[thinking] It has to be L. He had no qualms about putting a death raw inmate in his place when he declared war on me. It's pretty clear he doesn't know any limits.
Ryuk,Ugh. What I wanna know is how am I going to be able to eat apples?
Light,"[thinking] Obviously, that's impossible now, isn't it?"
Ryuk,"Oh, yeah. I guess you can't talk in here. But we'd better discuss this outside tomorrow."
Light,"Okay. I think I'm getting the hang of this now. [thinking] Judging by the number of cameras he's planted, he's planning to make a decision within a short period of time. Any normal person would slip under these circumstances, [""Kuroi Light"" stops] but it won't be that easy with me, L. [as he rips his bag of chips open:] This, is the closest you will get! [laughs softly]"
Ryuk,"[on the floor, laughs]"
,Brief shot of inside Light's chip bag. There's a shining coming from the bottom.
Light,"[thinking] I've set things up so that criminals will continue to die over the next three weeks. L is aware by now that Kira can control the times of death of his victims. Therefore, to avoid suspicion, L needs to see that criminals whose names are being broadcast continue to die while I have no access to that information."
Ryuk,[getting up into a handstand][panicking] Oooh! The symptoms are starting! Agggggh!
Light,"[cont'd][thinking] I'm gonna show you, L!"
,"Montage of Light writing and at one point, Ryuk spasming. We see there is a portable TV inside Light's bag of potato chips."
Light,"[cont'd][thinking] With Ryuk's information and my preparations, I can continue to kill criminals who names are broadcast on the news, while masquerading as a typical high school student studying for his entrance exams. Just watch me, L. I'll solve equations with my right hand and write names with my left. I'll take a potato chip and eat it!"
,Cut to Ryuzaki and Soichiro watching Light at his desk
Ryuzaki,"After dinner, your son just goes back to studying without turning on the TV or his computer?"
Soichiro,It's because the entrance exams are five days away.
Ryuzaki,Hmm...
,"He stares at the screen, which transitions to Light"
Light,"[thinking] Now, a criminal who I should have no knowledge of will die of a heart attack in forty seconds. And the witness to my alibi is L himself. [crunches up bag of chips and throws them in the trash][aloud] Alright. Just a little bit longer."
,Fade to black
,Cut to: Ryuzaki's suite. Watari approaches Ryuzaki and Soichiro
Watari,Ryuzaki.
Ryuzaki,"Yes? What is it, Watari?"
Watari,"[looking at note] A few minutes ago, a bank clerk being questioned on suspicion of embezzlement and a purse-snatcher being held in a detention center were broadcast on the news. They both just died of sudden, inexplicable heart attacks."
Soichiro,[stands up] It's him again.
Ryuzaki,"While all that was happening, at your home, your wife and daughter were watching television. When that was over, they turned the TV off and didn't watch anything afterwards. From just past seven-thirty until now, eleven o'clock, your son's done nothing but study. Kira needs a name and a face. Without those, he can't kill. So I suppose anyone who didn't watch the news can't be Kira, right?"
Soichiro,You said it yourself. That means my family has been cleared!
Ryuzaki,It doesn’t make sense that Kira would kill two petty criminals right after their identities were broadcast.
Soichiro,[gasps]
Ryuzaki,"I know it's only the first day after the cameras were installed, but the Yagami household almost seems too innocent to me. Hmm..."
,Cut to: Yagami household exterior in daytime
Sachiko,"[off-screen] Light, are you up yet?"
,Cut into Light's room
Light,"[yawning] Yeah, I'm awake."
Sachiko,"Today's garbage day, so if you've got any bring it down with you, okay?"
Light,[opening door and walking out with trashcan] What a pain.
,He tosses his trash into the larger bag as Sachiko talks
Sachiko,"[chuckles] What are you talking about? You usually say, ""there's no need to remind me, Mom."""
Light,"[walking away] Yeah, yeah."
,Cut to Light's room. He opens the window door and steps out onto the balcony. He groans and stretches. 
Light,Another beautiful day.
Ryuk,"Well, I can't say for sure whether you're extremely generous or just a spoilt brat.But didn't that mini-LCD TV cost you four hundred bucks?"
,Light watches his mother approach the garbage man with two trash bags
Sachiko,Good morning!
,Light watches her hand him the bags and the truck crunch up the garbage
,TO BE CONTINUED
,Ending credits
,Next episode preview
Light,"[chuckles] Perfect. There's no need for me to be worried. After all, this is proof that they don't have anything on me yet. So this whole thing is nothing more than a contest between L and I. A battle of wits."
,Opening Theme
,Higuchi's red car is surrounded by police cars. The muffling sound of a two-way radio can be heard.
Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, please, let me go and make the arrest."
,"Cut to Mogi, who is opening the door of a cop car, helmet in hand."
Mogi,"I'd like to come with you, Chief, if that's all right."
,Cuts to Light and Ryuzaki.
Ryuzaki,"I understand, but remember this is Kira. Be sure to take every precaution when you approach him, and don't allow him to see your face. Watari, if Higuchi tries anything or makes any sudden moves…"
,"Cuts to Watari, who is pointing a sniper."
Watari,"Understood. I will shoot to stop him, not to kill."
,"Cuts to Higuchi's car, with several police cars surrounding it. Footsteps can be heard as Mogi and the Chief approach him. Cuts to the inside of Aizawa's car. The window rolls down, and then cuts out to the Chief, both wearing helmets to hide their faces, standing next to Aizawa's car. Aizawa salutes them."
Soichiro,"Aizawa, do you have a helmet or something to hide your face with?"
Aizawa,I do.
Soichiro,Good. Then cover me.
Aizawa,"[Salutes] Yes sir. You can count on me, Chief."
,"Cut to a close up of Higuchi, his nose and above. He is sweating and bruised. He turns when the car door is opened, and it cuts to several cops standing outside of his car, some pointing their guns, and all with their faces covered."
Soichiro,"Higuchi, put your hands above your head and get out of the car."
,"Shot from underneath Higuchi's car. We see the silhouettes of five men, and then Higuchi's foot step out of the car and onto the pavement. Angle changes so that we see Higuchi step out of the car, raising his hands above his head. He's handcuffed and blindfolded."
Soichiro,We've apprehended him.
,Cuts to Light in the helicopter.
Light,"Mogi, I want you to put a headset on him as planned."
Mogi,"[Off-screen, voice muffled by two-way radio] Roger."
,"Back to Higuchi, who gets a headset put on him. Switches to another angle so that we see he has guns pointed at him."
Ryuzaki,"[Through two-way radio] Higuchi, how are you able to kill people? [pause] Tell me!"
Higuchi,"[Grunts, smiling]"
Ryuzaki,"If you're not going to talk, I'll use whatever means necessary to get it out of you."
Higuchi,The notebook.
Ryuzaki,[Through two-way radio] Notebook?
Higuchi,"You probably won't believe me, but I've got a special notebook. If I write someone's name in it while thinking about their face, that person dies."
Ryuzaki,[Thinking] A notebook.
,"Soichiro searches Higuchi's car, looking through a bag."
Ryuzaki,[Through two-way radio] Mr. Yagami?
Soichiro,"Yeah, I found it. [Sitting in driver's seat] It was in one of the compartments of Higuchi's bag. He has written a lot of names in it, but there doesn't seem to be anything else unusual about it. Huh?"
,"Cuts to Ryuzaki and Light, we hear Soichiro screaming. Soichiro falls onto the pavement, dropping the notebook."
Ryuzaki,"[Through two-way radio] What is it, Mr. Yagami?"
,"Angle changes, and we see Soichiro staring straight at Rem, who is now visible to us."
Soichiro,It's a monster!
Ryuzaki,"Please calm down. Don't panic; remember, you're not really armed to defend yourself."
Soichiro,"Oh… oh right, of course."
Mogi,"[Approaching Soichiro] Chief, hang in there. Are you all right?"
Soichiro,"Mogi, can't you see that thing over there?"
Mogi,"[Holds up the notebook] Chief, I think you must be getting tired. [Turns his head in the direction Soichiro is pointing, and then gasps, falling back and screaming]"
Light,"Mogi, what's wrong?"
Mogi,That… that thing. It seems that only people who have touched the notebook can… can see this… this monster.
Ryuzaki,[Through two-way radio] Please bring the notebook over to the helicopter.
Mogi,Uh… o-okay.
,Close-up of Rem.
Rem,"[Thinking] What in the world are you planning to do, Light Yagami? Once you take hold of that notebook again, all the memories of the Death Note and what you did when it was yours will return at once. However…"
Mogi,"[Holds notebook out to Ryuzaki] Here it is, Ryuzaki."
Ryuzaki,"Hmm… it really is… a Shinigami. They really… do… exist. [Thinking] Light Yagami… This is how Kira killed. No, the second Kira. ""Share our notebooks in Aoyama."" (his thoughts are rapid, thinking many things at once, difficult to make-out exactly what he is thinking)"
Light,"Ryuzaki, come on, let me see it!"
Ryuzaki,"[Thinking, thoughts now clear] Two books! There have to be two notebooks. Possibly more. This isn't over yet. [He looks at his hands, noticing the notebook is no longer in them. He turns to look at Light, whose mouth is wide and eyes hang wide open]"
,"Light begins screaming, his eyes glowing white, and we see visions of past events which occurred with the notebook rushing back to him. The screen goes white, then fades back to Light, who is panting."
Ryuzaki,"Are you okay, Light? I suppose seeing that monster would surprise anyone."
Light,Ryuzaki…
,Clicking sound.
Ryuzaki,What is it?
Light,I wanna check this out. I'm going to try comparing the names written in this notebook with the names of the victims.
Ryuzaki,"Hmm? Oh, right. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea."
,"Close-up of Light, his eyes red."
Light,[Thinking] I've won. Exactly as planned.
,Screen fades into a flashback of Light in a forest with Ryuk and Rem. He hands Misa's Death Note to Rem. We hear Light's Theme playing in the background.
Light,"I hereby forfeit ownership of this notebook. Now, that means ownership has transferred back to you, right?"
Rem,"Yes, I already told you."
Light,"Next, pass it on to Ryuk."
Rem,[Sigh] Very well. Here. [Hands notebook to Ryuk]
Light,"Now that notebook's ownership has transferred from you to Ryuk. Okay Ryuk, take the notebook and drop it on the ground, so it's in the human world again."
Ryuk,"Huh? Well, okay. [He drops the notebook, which Light then picks up]"
Light,Now the ownership goes back to me.
Ryuk,"Wow, hang on! It’s just gone around in a circle! Nothing's changed, right?"
Light,"Maybe at first glance, but there will be a time when I'll benefit from this. Now, as for this notebook, the one I first received, I’m gonna give it back to you, Ryuk. Then you hand it over to Rem."
,Light hands the notebook to Ryuk.
Ryuk,[Handing the notebook to Rem] Here.
Light,"Now, I want you to give the notebook to someone with status who lusts for power and money. They'll end up using the notebook to satisfy that urge."
,"Shots of Higuchi using the notebook, then back to Light and Rem in the forest."
Light,"If you do that, I can guarantee that Misa will be released from her confinement soon. If I'm wrong, and it looks like she won’t be released for years, then you can kill me. Does that sound fair to you?"
Rem,"Light Yagami, just what are you thinking?"
Light,"Look, this is all to save Misa. You're gonna have to trust me on this."
Rem,"All right. If it means that Misa will be saved, I'll do as you ask."
,"Rem flies away, as Light and Ryuk look on. We switch back and forth between scenes of Light’s confinement and Light and Ryuk in the woods."
Light,"After this, I'll go and demand to be confined like Misa, and have them put me under twenty-four hour surveillance as well. While I'm locked up, I'll relinquish ownership of the notebook to you. That'll mean I'll lose all my memories of the Death Note. During this time the killings of criminals will start again. Once that happens, Ryuzaki will be put in a position where he has to release us. And after I've lost all my memories, chances are I'll wanna help catch Kira myself. That's just the way I am."
Ryuk,So then you'll try and catch the guy who Rem gives the notebook to and steal it before L gets to it!
Light,"Right. Once that's done, I'll kill the new owner of the notebook. There's still one problem remaining."
,Flashback of Rem and Ryuk in Light’s room.
Rem,"If you don't have full ownership, your memories will only return for as long as you're in contact with the notebook. As soon as you let go of it, your memories will disappear again."
,"Fades to white and returns to present time, where Light is holding the notebook and cops are surrounding Higuchi's car."
Light,"[Thinking] That means I've gotta kill Higuchi without letting go of this notebook. If I manage to do that, ownership will transfer back to me and my memories won't disappear."
,Shot of Light's wristwatch and Light's hand pulling the bezel of his watch.
Light,I just have to pull this four times in less than a second.
,"A shifting sound is heard as a hidden compartment slides out of the watch, a piece of the Death Note hidden inside of it."
Light,Got it. Just as I expected: I'm wearing this watch. Old habits die hard.
,Light pricks himself with a needle. There is a pulsing sound as blood is drawn. He begins writing Higuchi’s name in blood on the piece of paper hidden in his watch. The pulsing sound can still be heard over Ryuzaki and Soichiro’s speaking.
Ryuzaki,"Mr. Yagami, please take Higuchi to the car."
Soichiro,"Uh, right. Of course."
,Light finishes writing Higuchi's name and breaths heavily in content. The pulsing sound stops and he turns to speak to Ryuzaki.
Light,"You know, about this notebook… I wonder what we would find if we put it through forensic analysis."
Ryuzaki,"That doesn't sound like you, Light. We both know this thing is beyond science."
Light,"[Laughs] Yeah, you're right. Hmm…"
,"Shot of Higuchi, being escorted by several officers. We see no background, just a canvas of white light shining behind them. We hear only the sound of shoes clicking on pavement as they walk, the screen then cuts back to Light and Ryuzaki, and then a close-up of Light's eyes. The sound of the footsteps ceases as we hear Light’s inner thoughts."
Light,[Thinking] This has gotta be the longest forty seconds of my life.
,"Seeing his hand holding the notebook, we begin to hear the ticking of his watch, everything else still remaining silent, and the screen goes from Light to Ryuzaki, to Light’s watch. To Light’s eye widening. The ticking stops and Light sighs in relief. Back to Higuchi and the cops, we hear two quick pulsing sounds. Higuchi gags, his face contorting. Over the sound of Higuchi’s gasping and grunting, Soichiro speaks up."
Soichiro,"Ryuzaki, Higuchi is—"
Light,What the hell?! What's happening?
,"Higuchi drops to his knees, his head falling back, eyes and mouth wide open."
Soichiro,Hey! Higuchi!
Light,"Dad, what are you doing? We can't lose him! If Higuchi dies on us now—"
Soichiro,[Through two-way radio] This is impossible! The… but… [Sighs] There's nothing I can do. He's already…
Light,"[Thinking] Yes. He's already dead. And you're next, Ryuzaki."
,"Zoomed out so that we see the crime scene again, chants sounding."
,Eyecatch
Eyecatch,
,"A faded image of Misa sitting on a couch reading a magazine, the screen then transitions to Ryuzaki, who is smiling at the screen showing Misa. We are back at HQ, the Task Force and Rem standing silently. Matsuda shifts uncomfortably and Aizawa opens the Death Note, reading it aloud."
Aizawa,"""How to use it."" It says, ""The human whose name is written in this notebook… shall die. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his or her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected. If the cause of death is written forty seconds of writing the person’s name, it will happen. If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack. After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next six minutes and forty seconds."" [Flips to the back of the notebook] As well, the back cover has some more instructions on how to use it. There are two more rules. One of them is, ""If you make this note unusable by tearing it up or burning it, all the humans who have touched the note till then will die."""
Matsuda,"What?! Is that really true, Aizawa?"
Light,"[Thinking] That's right. With a rule like that in place, the notebook's safety is guaranteed, which means my memories of it will remain."
,Matsuda and Aizawa can be heard talking under Light’s thoughts.
Aizawa,"Yeah, that’s what it says."
Matsuda,No way! That sucks! Why didn't you tell me before I touched it?
Aizawa,How was I supposed to know? I'm in the same boat and I don't—
,"Flashback begins once Light is done thinking, cutting off Aizawa's sentence."
Ryuk,"Rem, there's no way the old man back home will get mad at us if we write fake rules in here, is there?"
Rem,No. There are no rules against doing so.
Ryuk,"Fine then, Light, I'll do it. But you owe me an apple for this. [Cackles]"
Matsuda,"[Puts his hand on his head] Oh man, maybe I shouldn't have let my curiosity about seeing a Shinigami get the better of me."
Soichiro,"Maybe, but then you would be the only one in the investigation who didn't know what we were dealing with. Is that what you want?"
Matsuda,"Uh, no, of course not. I wanna be on the same page as everyone else on the Task Force, Chief."
Aizawa,"[Takes his eyes off of Matusda and returns to reading the Death Note] And then… [Sighs] there's this last rule. According to these instructions in the back of the notebook, ""If the person using the note fails to consecutively to be killed within thirteen days of each other, then the user will die."""
Matsuda,"[Gasps] Wait a second. If that's true, then it means Light and Misa-Misa are completely clear, doesn't it?"
Aizawa,"Yeah, now that you mention it, that's right. Light and Misa were detained for more than fifty days and are still under surveillance. If either of them had been Kira, there's no way they would still be alive by now."
Matsuda,"Wow, that’s great news, isn't it, Chief?"
Soichiro,Yeah.
Ryuzaki,"Rem, was it? That's your name, isn't it? The white thing over there?"
Matsuda,"Ryuzaki, isn't it a bit rude to go around calling someone a ""white thing""?"
Rem,What do you want?
Ryuzaki,"There's more than one notebook in the human world, isn't there?"
Rem,Who knows. There may be and there may not be.
Ryuzaki,"If there are other notebooks either here or in your world, would they all have the same rules as this one?"
Light,"[Thinking] You're wasting your time, Ryuzaki. You'll never get Rem to admit these rules are fake."
Rem,"Yes, they are all the same. There are many notebooks in the Shinigami Realm, but they all have the same rules. Even the rules for when humans obtain them."
Aizawa,Ryuzaki! Misa Amane and Light have both been cleared of suspicion. They shouldn’t be under surveillance any longer.
Matsuda,"That's right, it's crystal clear!"
Ryuzaki,"I suppose you're right… I understand. Please, except my apologies for all the trouble."
,"Light hides a grin, and Matsuda sighs in relief."
Soichiro,[Walks up to Light and puts a hand on his shoulder] Thank goodness.
Light,"Yeah, but… [Stands up from the chair he’s sitting in] We still can’t say we’ve solved the case until we’ve figured out everything. Would it be all right if I kept investigating with you, without the handcuffs on?"
Ryuzaki,Yes.
Light,"[Thinking] And just like that, Misa and I are proven innocent. A notebook of death filled with rules written by a Shinigami. He has no choice but to believe it. He just lost his edge thanks to the fake rules I created. Listen Ryuzaki: no matter what the world, the god of that world creates the rules. In truth, you've already been defeated by the rules I created. And as punishment for defying the god of the New World, you will die."
,Skips forward in time. We see skyscrapers. Cut to outside HQ.
Misa,"[Hugs Light] Oh, Light! Be sure to text me every day, okay?"
Matsuda,"[Cries into his sleeve] Oh, after all this time, we're saying goodbye to Misa-Misa."
Aizawa,"[Cutting in near the end of Matsuda's sentence, grabbing his shoulder and pulling him away] Knock it off, Matsuda! Let's leave them alone."
,"Matsuda whimpers as he is pulled away, his hand outstretched towards Light and Misa. He's pulled off screen and the focus shifts to Light and Misa, who are still hugging."
Matsuda,[Off-screen] Goodbye Misa-Misa!
Aizawa,[Off-screen] Enough!
,Sound of a door slamming shut.
Light,"[Looks up to see a surveillance camera] [Thinking] Good, there are surveillance cameras, but they won't be able to pick out my face or mouth at this angle. [Aloud] Misa, I'm gonna tell you about a special place. I need you to go there and dig something up, but you have to make sure that no one is watching."
Misa,"[Thinking] Light! Your memory must have returned! Don't worry, I can do this. I won't let you down."
,"Misa's Theme is playing. Screen fades in and fades out to and from black, revealing the forest from Light’s flashback. Misa is unwrapping something. We zoom in to see her taking her Death Note out of a metal box. There is a pulsing sound and she gasps, her memories rushing back. We fade in and out to and from white, Misa sitting with her notebook, dumbfound."
Misa,"[Looks at the notebook and laughs in delight] [Thinking] Light, I remember! I remember everything that happened when I had this notebook. You buried this one so I could come here and regain my memories. [She flips through the notebook and a folded up piece of paper falls out onto the ground] [Aloud] Huh?"
,"The screen transitions to Misa holding the now unfolded paper, reading it. We hear Light’s voice sounding far-off, reading the letter."
Light's voice,"Dear Misa, by the time you read this letter, you should've remembered everything."
Misa,"[Thinking] Oh, a letter from Light!"
Light's voice,"Do you remember my friend at To-Oh University? He went by the name ""Hideki Ryuga."" I want you to write his real name in the notebook and kill him, then burn this letter right away. Take a number of pages from the notebook, and rebury it where you found it. The next time that we see each other, casually touch me with a piece of the notebook. If you do this for me, I promise I will love you for the rest of my life."
Misa,"[Reading the words aloud at the same time Light’s voice says them] …for the rest of my life! Yay! [Looks up from the letter] [Thinking] Now I see. This was all part of Light's plan! He wanted me to get this notebook, regain all my memories, and then kill Hideki Ryuga. Kill Ryuzaki. One of Light's biggest obstacles will be gone, and I'll be helpful to him at last! [Slouches forward in disappointment] Oh, but Light, it's no good! I don’t remember his name anymore!"
,"We see flashbacks through Misa’s Shinigami Eyes, everything is red, and we see man different names and lifespans of strangers"
Misa,"[Thinking] I was seeing dozens—no, no hundreds of names and lifespans every day! [Closes her eyes and looks to the sky, crying] [Aloud] Oh! I can't remember it no matter what!"
,"The flapping of wings is heard, and we see Ryuk’s back as he comes back down into the human world."
Misa,"Oh, I'm such an idiot!"
,"Ryuk lands on a tree branch, staring down at Misa, who notices him."
Misa,Huh?
Ryuk,[Sigh of content] I finally return to the human world!
Misa,Huh? Ryuk!
,"Pan out, revealing Misa with her arms wrapped around Ryuk, hanging off of his neck and kicking her legs wildly."
Misa,"Oh, it's been so long! Oh, I'm so glad to see you. How are you doing?"
Ryuk,"[As Misa asks how he’s doing] Sorry, uh. [Ryuk becomes transparent, and Misa falls to the ground]"
Misa,Ugh!
Ryuk,"I'm a guy, I get a little shy, some…times."
Misa,[Giggles]
,"Misa walks over to her bag, fishing through it for something as she talks to Ryuk."
Misa,"Oh yeah, I almost forgot. [Holds out an apple] Here!"
Ryuk,"[Laughs in surprise, eyes dilating]"
Misa,Light told me to bring one for you.
Ryuk,[Devouring the apple noisily as Misa talks]
Misa,Is it really that good?
Ryuk,"[Pauses from eating to speak] Oh yeah. Human apples are—what's the word—juicy, I think. They're great, anyway. [Puts the core into his mouth and reaches behind his back, his words sounding distorted as he speaks with his mouth full] Ay don' you try dis? [Holds out a Shinigami apple]"
Misa,Huh?
Ryuk,[Gulps] An apple from the Shinigami world.
Misa,"[Takes apple and looks at it in distaste] Uhh… Ew, it doesn't look very good."
Ryuk,"Come on, one bite won't kill ya."
Misa,"Mmm… By the way, before I forget, I want you to make the eye deal with me. [Bites into apple, then throws it on the ground at spits it out] Peh! Peh! It's sand! Bleh. [Looks up expectantly at Ryuk]"
Ryuk,"A deal, huh?"
Misa,[Nods] Mhmm.
Ryuk,"You understand what that means? You already made the same deal with Rem once before. Are you sure you really want me to cut your lifespan in half, for a second time?"
Misa,"I know, but what choice do I have? You see, I've forgotten a name that I absolutely have to remember. [Sighs] Light will be so mad at me if I let him down."
Ryuk,"Heh, well it's fine with me."
,"Fades to and from black, Misa is standing in front of the building. There is a buzzing sound, followed by a beeping sound. We now see Misa via surveillance camera inside the headquarters."
Matsuda,"Hey, it's Misa-Misa. The poor girl. As long as we're stuck in here, we can't turn our cellphones on, so she has to come all the way out here just to hang out with Light."
Soichiro,"Light, would you hurry up and go see her? Don't you know, you should never keep a woman waiting."
Light,[Turns around and heads to the door] Okay.
Rem,[Looks at Misa on the monitor] [Thinking] Huh? Ryuk. Why is he attached to Misa. …Huh?
,"Through Rem's eyes, everything in red, we see the surveillance monitor, and watch as Misa runs toward Light and embraces him."
Rem,[Thinking] Misa's lifespan! It's been halved again! No! Did she make the eye deal with Ryuk?
,"Outside, with Misa and Light."
Misa,Hey Light. [Taps Light's hand with a scrap piece of paper from her Death Note]
Light,"[Turning away from Misa] It's been a while, Ryuk."
Ryuk,
[Cackles],
Misa,"Light, I'm so sorry! I don't remember Hideki Ryuga's real name! I tried, but I totally forgot!"
Light,"Oh, I see. Well, that's too bad."
Misa,"But I did the eye deal with Ryuk, so I can try again!"
Ryuk,"[Thinking] So, everything's going according to plan…"
Light,"You idiot! [Putting his hand on her shoulder] If you do that, then you’re lifespan will—"
Misa,"Mmm… no, it's all right. I just want to be of use to you, Light."
Light,"Misa, all I want is to enjoy a long life with you in an ideal world. That's just how I feel."
Misa,"[Hugs Light, eyes teary] Light, I'm so happy."
Light,"Let's create a New World together. It'll be a place with no crime, where only kind people live. Okay?"
Misa,Yeah.
,"The screen goes back and forth between Light and Misa and Ryuzaki, ending at Light, who is holding Misa, his eyes glowing red and grinning maniacally."
,Ending credits
,Next episode preview
,Ryuzaki standing on the roof of a building in the middle of the rain.
Ryuzaki,Goodbye.
,Opening theme
,"The sun shines brightly. Children are shouting in the background, playing, and multiple of them are shown doing different activities. They seem to be in some sort of church. A particular child can be heard crying in the background. Suddenly, the wailing and all other noise ceases. Before a tall, pointed structure, where it is snowing, the ringing of bells is heard. Watari is seen standing next to a small child with black hair, squeezing his hand to comfort him. The two are in front of the building, which is surrounded by a fence, the same building that the children were playing in front of moments before. There's a fluttering sound, like that of old film, and the scene breaks, as if an old film reel is ending…"
,"Present day, Task Force Headquarters, it is late at night and everything is completely silent. For a moment, it is seemingly from Ryuzaki's point of view, but not for long; the scene flickers into where Watari is sitting in front of many screens, slumped in his chair, engulfed in darkness."
Watari,"[Turning around in his seat to look at Ryuzaki] (Quietly) Ryuzaki, is something the matter? What is it? [Pause, silence] … Hmm?"
,"It is then from a different angle, where Ryuzaki is stood in the doorway and both are staring at each other."
Watari,(Carefully) What's wrong?
,Ryuzaki simply remains stationary. There is only silence.
,"Ryuzaki is then sat in his usual position, examining a page in the Death Note that has been torn off."
Ryuzaki,…Interesting. A corner of a page of this notebook appears to have been torn off. Can you kill someone just by writing their name on a piece?
Rem,"Can't say. I've never tried using it like that, so I wouldn't know, and I don't know of anyone who has."
Ryuzaki,"Then let me ask you, do Gods of Death love apples?"
Rem,"Not necessarily. You see, our internal organs have already degraded. We've… evolved to a point where we do not require sustenance."
Ryuzaki,"[Eating some sort of sweets. Although he addresses Light, he doesn't turn around to look at him] Say, Light. You're finally free to leave headquarters on your own, but it seems like you never go out. Even when Misa comes to visit, you only chat with her for a few minutes outside. You do realize you're free to have a relationship with her now?"
Light,[Lingering by the staircase] That can wait until we've managed to solve this case. I'm not in the mood for love or anything else right now… (bristling) or are you suggesting that you have a problem with me being here?
Ryuzaki,No…
,"Ryuzaki is looking warily at Light out of the corner of his eye, frozen in place. Light simply stares back, where Ryuzaki can't see, and his eyes are reflected in the glass staircase."
,"The screen switches between Light and Ryuzaki, eventually ending outside, with Misa waving goodbye to Light and leaving. Next is a transition to what appears to be Misa's house."
Light's voice,(Echoing) Right now I'm in no position to continue punishing criminals. That's why I need you to punish them for me. Misa... let's create a new world together.
,"Outdoors, the chime of bells sound. Eerie music starts as Misa walks down the streets, donning a black dress and heavy make-up. Throughout this scene, it shows her writing, and several dead citizens."
Misa,"(Singing quietly) Careful what you do… 'cause God is watching your every move. Hold my hand in the dark street. For if you do I know that I'll be safe. Even if I'm far away and alone, I can be sure that you'll find me there, this I know. You draw me close for a while, so quiet. You tell me everything. If I forget what you say, then you'd come to me and tell me again. Yes, you'd tell me once again. But what happens when…I know it all? Then what should I do after that? What then?"
,"At the Task Force Headquarters, various noises can be heard."
Soichiro,(Hasty) What was that? I heard criminals are being killed again!
Aizawa,There were sixteen deaths yesterday alone. All of them were broadcast after Higuchi's death.
Matsuda,"Immediately after, huh?"
Soichiro,Do you think this could mean Higuchi wasn't necessarily Kira after all?
Light,I don't know. It's safe to say that Higuchi was the one killing criminals until we apprehended him.
Aizawa,Then this means we're dealing with yet another Kira.
Matsuda,Aww man! Not again!
Light,"Damn. Damn you, Kira!"
Ryuzaki,"[Looking in Light's vague direction out of the corner of his eyes again, who is behind him. He is holding a panda cookie in mid-air] (Brooding) Kira… again?"
Rem,"(Thinking, shocked) I can't believe this! It has to be Misa."
Ryuzaki,"These killings began as soon as Misa was freed, didn't they?"
Light,"(Curt) Ryuzaki, I can't believe you're still saying that. She has nothing to do with this! Think about it; this started as soon as Higuchi died."
Ryuzaki,"[Turning over a bag of treats to pour out any of the remaining contents] That's true. If there is another notebook floating around out there and someone is now using it to kill [Crushes panda cookie between his fingers] criminals, I'll just have to bring that person to justice."
,"Ryuzaki eats two cookies, and then looks down at the piece of paper in the Death Note that has a portion torn out. L's theme begins to play in the background."
Ryuzaki,"(Thinking, voice a mere whisper) The Shinigami insisted that it didn't know, but if someone were able to kill simply by writing a name on a torn piece of the notebook…"
,"Cuts to an image of Light writing down names as he eats out of a bag of potato chips, then Higuchi dying."
Ryuzaki,"…It's not impossible, but there is that rule: 'whoever writes a name in this notebook has to write another name within thirteen days, otherwise they die'. Light Yagami and Misa Amane are both still alive… thirteen days; that's the only problem."
Light,"Ryuzaki, I've been thinking. Even if we do manage to catch the person who’s been writing names in the notebook, will we really be able to legally convict and punish them for mass homicide?"
Matsuda,"(Passionate) What? Of course we can convict them! This guy’s intentionally writing names in the notebook knowing that these people are going to die. Even if we don't plan on publicly acknowledging the notebook, the least we can do is execute the killer!"
,A look of realization forms on Rem's face and she gasps.
Aizawa,"[Off-screen] It's not a very humane way to do things, but the higher-ups would probably wanna take measures like that."
Ryuzaki,"If they admit to killing with the notebook they'd receive the death penalty. Or life in prison at least. [Eats a cookie, talks with his mouth full] (Muffled) That’s the best that they could hope for."
Rem,"(Thinking) What are you thinking, Light Yagami? Making Misa kill again! She'll be caught and then once that happens you'll also be— [Gasps; sound of church bell ringing in the background] …So that's what your plan is! You're truly disgusting."
,"Light looks at Rem out of the corner of his eye, smirking."
Rem,"(Thinking) Light Yagami is certain that I will do anything to help Misa and save her life. And at this point, the only way for me to save Misa is to write Ryuzaki's real name in my notebook! [Church bell rings] And if I kill Ryuzaki…"
,Flashback of Gelus dying.
Rem,"(Thinking) …It would mean that I deliberately lengthened Misa's life, and I will die as well. Light Yagami has planned everything so that it will work out in his favor! [Church bell rings]"
Light,"(Thinking) [Eyes glowing a dark red] What are you gonna do, Rem? You may be a Shinigami, but you can't hide the fact that you have a thing for Misa. There's no way that you would turn your back on her now, after she's already halved her lifespan twice. Come on. [Church bell rings] Think about Misa's happiness… [Church bell rings]"
,Commercial break.
,"Light walks silently down a hallway and ominous whirring sounds slowly begin to grow louder. He goes outside, where it is raining heavily; the sound of the rain falls onto pavement loudly."
,"He reaches the roof, where he notices Ryuzaki is already standing in the rain, looking at the sky, droplets threaded in his hair. Ryuzaki looks at the sky for a few seconds before he notices Light, a strange expression on his face."
Light,[Careful] What are you doing standing out there by yourself?
,"Ryuzaki cups his ear, unable to hear Light over the sound of the rain."
Light,[Cups his mouth and leans forward] (Shouting) What are you doing standing out there by yourself?
,"Ryuzaki momentarily takes his hand off of his ear, but then puts it back. His smile is bashful as he taunts Light, acting unlike himself for a moment. Light doesn't break a grin in return—instead, he sighs, but he covers his head with his hand and steps out into the rain, walking towards Ryuzaki."
Light,"What are you doing, Ryuzaki?"
Ryuzaki,"[Staring at the ground] Oh, nothing worth mentioning… It's just…I hear the bell."
Light,The bell?
Ryuzaki,Yes. The sound of the bell's been unusually loud today.
,Light follows Ryuzaki's gaze to the bells above them.
Light,I don't hear anything.
Ryuzaki,"(Mumbling distractedly) Really? You can't hear it? It's been ringing incessantly all day. I find it…very distracting. I can't stop thinking about it. I wonder if it's a church—maybe a wedding, or perhaps a—"
Light,"(Interrupts) What are you getting at, Ryuzaki? Come on, cut it out—let's get back inside."
Ryuzaki,"[Pause, Ryuzaki seems almost self-conscious, hunching his shoulders] … I'm sorry. Nothing I say makes any sense anyway. [Sighs] If I were you, I wouldn't believe any of it…"
,"For a few seconds, he looks at the ground again. His expression is rather lonely, almost remorseful."
Light,"[Pause] … You know, you're right, Ryuzaki. Most of the things you say aren't true. There'd be no end to my troubles if I actually took you seriously all the time… I probably know that better than anyone."
Ryuzaki,"Yes, I suppose that's true, Light-kun. [Silence] But…I could say the same about you."
Light,"[Looks up at Ryuzaki, faintly surprised] What do you mean?"
Ryuzaki,"(Careful) Tell me, Light, from the moment you were born, has there ever been a point when you've actually told the truth?"
,"Sound of rainfall abruptly stops. There is an unreadable expression on Light's face, and he and Ryuzaki glower at one another. Ryuzaki's eyes are like black holes."
Light,"What are you saying? (Defensive) Certainly I lie every once in a while, but surely no one can be truthful throughout their entire life? People aren't that perfect. Everyone lies. But, even so, I've made a point of not telling lies that will hurt others. [Pause] … That's my answer."
,"Ryuzaki stares at Light. Then, his eyes drop wordlessly to the floor again."
Ryuzaki,(Mumbling) … I…thought you'd say that.
,Both are silent.
Ryuzaki,[Pause] … Let's go back inside. We're both soaked.
Light,[Pause] … Yeah.
,"The scene changes to the pair of them when inside. Light is sat at the top of some steps, his trainers drying out from the rain, running a towel over his hair. Ryuzaki walks over, his own towel on his head."
Ryuzaki,"That was quite an ordeal, wasn't it?"
Light,[Still drying] (Tiredly) It's your fault for being out in that downpour.
Ryuzaki,True. I'm sorry.
,"It flickers to where Ryuzaki is still lingering; he's looking at Light with owlish eyes, who is still toweling his hair. He removes his towel from where it's resting on his head, expression unfathomable."
,"Light continues with closed eyes, seemingly in thought. When, he opens them a heartbeat later, he gasps; Ryuzaki is sat before him on the steps, holding his foot in one hand, looking up at him in earnest. Immediately, Light drops his towel, eyes widening."
Light,"(Startled) …What are you doing, Ryuzaki?!"
Ryuzaki,(Unfazed) I thought I'd help. You seem to be drying yourself with quite some fervor.
Light,It's fine. You don't have to do that.
Ryuzaki,"(Dead serious) I'll throw in a massage? [He doesn't allow Light to reply, speaking quickly and quietly] At least allow me to atone for this. I'm not at all bad at it, you know."
Light,"[Pause, he stares at L before looking away] … (Sighing) Do as you please."
Ryuzaki,(Whispers) Okay.
,"Everything is silent as Ryuzaki pauses, gazing silently at Light's feet. Then, he slowly brings his own towel up to Light's foot; the movement of the towel against it is rough, and Light jumps, tensing, eyes locked on the wordless Ryuzaki."
Light,Oi.
Ryuzaki,You'll get used to it quickly.
,"Again, there is silence, and Ryuzaki has stopped. His face is concealed by dripping black hair, and Light watches as the droplets land on his ankle, where the former is holding it. There is a strange look in Light's eyes."
,"Slowly, Light turns to the side and picks up his discarded towel. He reaches forward and gently brushes over Ryuzaki's hair and face with it, collecting the rain. Ryuzaki doesn't move as Light does this, stare and hand still on Light's ankle."
Light,(Softly) You're still wet.
Ryuzaki,(Still whispering) … Sorry…
,"Light doesn't say anything. Eventually, Ryuzaki returns to carefully drying Light's foot, still thinking, and Light watches him. For a while, piano music plays in the background, until Ryuzaki pauses. Now, they are both whispering."
Ryuzaki,"(Wistful) … It'll be lonely, won't it?"
Light,[Snaps out of his trance] Huh?
,"It is then that Ryuzaki finally looks at Light, and when he does, there's a ghost of a sad smile on his lips."
Ryuzaki,"[Pause, smiling gently] … You and I will be parting ways soon."
,"They hold each other's gazes until the piano music begins to fade, and Light looks numb, almost in shock. What interrupts this is the ringing of Ryuzaki's phone; he drops the towel, holding the phone to his ear. All the while, Light is staring at his back."
Ryuzaki,"(On the phone) Yes? … Understood. I'll be there straight away. [Puts his phone back in his pocket, back still to Light] Shall we go then? Light-kun. [Pause] … It…looks like things have gone well."
,"He leaves no time for Light to respond, because he walks away quickly. Light is still staring at him in astonishment, but hurries to follow Ryuzaki."
,Outside the rain is still heavy. Ryuzaki and Light pass the doors to where the others are gathered.
Matsuda,"(Panicking) Ryuzaki, what's the meaning of this?! You've got permission from a ruined country to use the notebook in an execution?!"
Ryuzaki,"[Ignores Matsuda and sits in his chair] Watari, good job."
Watari,(From behind the computer screen) No problem.
Ryuzaki,Please begin the arrangements to transport the notebook at once.
Watari,Yes.
Light,(Rushed) Ryuzaki! What's going on?
Ryuzaki,[Picks up his spoon and waves it above the open Death Note] We're going to test this notebook for real.
,"Everyone in the room, excluding Ryuzaki, gasps in horror."
Aizawa,(Loudly) We can't do that! And there's no point in testing it now when we already know the notebook's power is real.
Matsuda,"And besides, who's gonna write the name? If someone starts writing in the notebook, they will have to obey the 13-day rule and keep writing names forever!"
Ryuzaki,"It's already been worked out. The person who will write in the notebook is a criminal scheduled to be executed in just over 13 days. If he's still alive 13 days after writing the name, he will be pardoned from execution."
,Matsuda gasps.
Soichiro,"(Eyes down, conflicted) But still, to sacrifice a life--"
Ryuzaki,"(With a sudden harshness) We're very close. If we work this out, the entire case will be solved."
,"The music crescendos, and lightning strikes over the roof. The camera suddenly flashes to Rem, whose eyes are glowing, and is shown to be standing behind Ryuzaki. It shows more lightning behind the building, and then back again to the task force. The light from the screens suddenly cuts out, and begins blaring a bright red. An alarm sounds."
Matsuda,(Panicking) What is this?! A blackout?
,"Ryuzaki's stern expression is shown. In Watari's office, we see Rem standing over him. He is slumped on top of his computer, groaning in pain. Rem retreats as Watari struggles to reach behind the keyboard of his computer. His groaning turns to gasping and sweat beads on his forehead. Ryuzaki's face appears on the screen."
Ryuzaki,(Shocked) Watari?
,"The camera reveals what Watari was reaching for- a square red button on the back of the keyboard. He presses it. One by one, the cameras display a blank white screen with the words ""All data deletion""."
Ryuzaki,Watari!
,"Watari collapses to the floor, dead."
Aizawa,Data deletion? What the hell is going on?
Ryuzaki,I told Watari to make sure that he should erase all information in the event that something were to happen to him
Aizawa,If something were to happen?
Matsuda,Could it be?
Ryuzaki,(Looks behind him) Where's the shinigami?
Soichiro,Good question. I don't see it.
,Rem writes a name in her death note
Mogi,It dissapeared!
,Task force members look around
Soichiro,What's going on?
Ryuzaki,"Everyone, the shiniga-"
,L stops talking. A heartbeat sound plays. Light stares at L triumphantly.
,"L's spoon drops out of his hand.He slowly falls off his chair, as Light watches. Light dives, intending to look like he was trying to save L."
Matsuda,Ryuzaki! What's wrong?!
,Matsuda dashes towards L
,The bell tolls for the final time
,Light stares at L's body as he holds him in his arms.
,"L hallucinates the bells tolling once more, he sees the roof of the church. He sees a child crying. More visions."
,Rem begins disentegrating
,"More visions of the church, he sees the trees of the Wammy's House as a bright light overtakes his vision."
,L is dead.
,Light smiles.
,L's eyes slowly close
,Lights peformance begins
Light,(Sadly) He-hey? Ryuzaki? Come on! Snap out of it!
Soichiro,What happened?
Mogi,What's going on?
,"Light screams, seemingly in terror"
Soichiro,Calm down Light.
Light,"(Apparently fearfully) We're all gonna die! Watari, Ryuzaki.. It'll be us next!"
,Aizawa gasps stumbles backwards and falls. Matsuda screams. Soichiro gasps. Mogi is in shock.
,"Light smiles, knowing they've fallen for it."
Light,Damn you! Where are you shinigami!? Come out!
Soichiro,"Wait, Light!"
Light,"You know something about this, don't you? Come on out!"
,Light walks out
Soichiro,We better go and look too.
Matsuda,Right.
Aizawa,"Mogi, take over for me"
Mogi,"Okay. (Walks over to Aizawa, taking over holding L's body)"
,Rest of the task force follows Light
,"Light stands over the pile of ash, formerly Rem. He grabs her death note."
Light,There's something here!
Soichiro,(Looking at Rem's ashes) What the hell is this stuff?
Matsuda,Sand?
Soichiro,What does this mean?
Light,"Whatever it might mean, whatever happens next, I swear i will avenge Ryuzaki's death. I'm going to solve this case in honour of him... and for Watari... and all the other victims."
Soichiro,Light...
Aizawa,Let's do this. For them.
Matsuda,Yeah but... aren't we all gonna get killed? Isn't that what all of this really means?
Light,"Matsuda, if you're afraid of dying then leave the investigation. We put our lives on the line when we chose to be here."
Matsuda,Yeah that's true. But.. it's weird hearing you say that. You sound like Ryuzaki
,"Light walks away, confident that the task force will want him to replace L"
,Light walks in a hallway.
Light,I've gotten rid of everything in my way.
,Lightning crashes as Light smiles menacingly
Light,I am the god of the new world
,TO BE CONTINUED
,Outro
,Opening Theme
,"Lightning strikes; Rem inside of Task Force Headquarters, eyes glowing red. The screens the task force are looking at all go red, and there is a beeping sound."
Touta Matsuda,What is this?
,"Rem is alone with Watari, who is grunting in pain as he collapses onto the floor. With his ounce of strength, Watari looks at Ryuzaki on the screen, and then presses a button on his keyboard which deletes all data. Ryuzaki's image on the screen turns to static and then goes black. Rem hastily writes in her Death Note, and everything is red."
Ryuzaki,Everyone! The shiniga— [heartbeat] uh. [heartbeat]
,"Shot of Light Yagami, and then a closeup of Ryuzaki's hand, dropping his spoon. Ryuzaki falls off of his chair onto the ground in slow motion. Closeup of Light. The screen fades to black, and the title screen ""Renewal"" fades in, ""L's Theme A"" playing in the background."
,Flashbacks of L's first confrontation with Kira
L,"Now, try to kill me!"
,
,"Although this was announced as a worldwide broadcast, the truth is, we are only broadcasting in the Kanto region of Japan. [Flashback of news broadcast reporting on Kuro Otoharada]"
,
,"In actuality, the first of your victims was a suspect in Shinjuku. Furthermore, his crime was only ever reported inside of Japan. [Shot of L talking through voice modifier] I used that information to deduce this much: [Takuo Shibuimaru's death scene] You are in Japan, and your first victim was little more than an, experiment, which means that you haven't been killing for very long. [Shot of policemen doing various activities, including reading reports Kira has found a way to obtain information from the Task Force Headquarters]"
,
,"There are one-hundred and forty-one people in the police force who have access to classified information regarding the investigation. [L setting down a pile of dossiers, including Soichiro Yagami's]"
,
,"I'm sure that somewhere in this list of police officers, and the people closest to them… we will find our suspect. [Shot of Raye Penber as the subject shifts]"
,
,"On December 14th, twelve FBI investigators enter Japan. [Shots of the suicide note a prisoner wrote, dead prisoners, and the pentagram of blood that had been drawn on the wall]"
,
,"Here we are on December 19th. Using prison inmates, Kira conducts experiments, manipulating his victims' actions before they die."
,
,"[Flashback of Kiichiro Osoreda shooting at Ryuk, Raybe Penber ordering everyone to duck for cover, and then Kiichiro fleeing the bus as an oncoming vehicle approaches]"
,
,He needed to know how much control over his victims he had before he could use it against the twelve agents.
,
,[Screen fades to black and then fades in onto the scene of Kiichiro's death]
,
,"I suspect Kira [flashback of Raye Penber and Light's confrontation at the subway] had to be one of the people being investigated by the FBI, [Raye Penber dying of a heart attack] Between the fourteenth, and the nineteenth of December. In fact I have no doubt. [flashback of L getting a call] Raye Penber's fiancée? Naomi Misora. So it's her…"
